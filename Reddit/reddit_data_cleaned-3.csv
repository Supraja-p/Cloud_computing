thats cold as fuck
its pretty obvious what newsom was doing here he was torpedoing desantis political career  he didnt give a damn what fox news people think about california he was constantly bringing up desantis contradictions with trumps policies and how other republicans called him out  hes making sure that desantis dying political campaign stays dead  he set the tone right from the start when he said one thing we both have in common neither of us will be a nominee for president
hannity the border is a problem right

newsome yes of course it is that is why i support bidens 15 billion dollar boarder bill that willhannity interrupting were running out of time  put 2800 new border agents provide millions for new technology at the border hannity panic interrupting uhhh break ron florida good
youre trying to out trump trump by the way hows that going for you ron youre  down 41 points in your own state lmao
newsom agreed to a 2 v 1 and thats balls
in an alternate reality the primetime showdown between california democratic gov gavin newsom and florida republican gov ron desantis on thursday could have been a preview of a 2024 general election debate

instead it was a hardtoexplain 90minute clash that pitted one struggling republican presidential hopeful against a democratic rival who may or may not seek the presidency in four years

this is a slick slippery politician whose state is failing desantis said of newsom

hows that going for you ron youre down 41 points in your own home state said newsom who is backing biden for president neither of us will be the nominee for a party in 2024
oh this is going to be entertaining isnt it 

gavins been in government for decades and ron eats pudding with his fingers
i like how desantis has an actual voting record and when newsom brings it up all desantis says is thats a lie thats a lie no its not look up his record
what going unsaid in the debate is the reason so many people flee california because so many people are trying to live here they want to live here but that pressure and the lack of housing to meet it is pushing people out 

now not building enough housing is a policy failure but its not a tax policy failure its not a crime police failure its not any kind of cultural failure its simply giving in too much to nimbys 

fortunartely california is finally addressing this at a state level localities are now having their housing plans decertified and permitting streamlines until those localities prove they are meeting demand
lets not kid ourselves it was set up to be a shitshow newsom had nothing to lose and is practicing for the future hard to believe desantis is harvard and yale educated
newsom starts actually listing biden accomplishments

hannity lets move on
hannity is awful as a moderator
unbiased moderator now in debate with one of the participants lmao
i hope im not alone in this  but i dont come over to foxland oftenthese commercials are fuckin wild
fox news literally just put californias full covid numbers and then they used floridas age adjusted covid numbers
they seem a bit panicked anytime newsome is allowed to talk for longer than 10 seconds
hannity moving on again after newsom went too hard on facts
earlier

hanity why are we talking about biden isnt this fl vs ca

20 minutes later lets talk the border why do you like bidens administration

geeze
lol desantis was scared to stand next to newsom who is over 6ft tall so he kicked up his kitten heels and tiptoed off stage
no live audience is a good thing these are people whose decisions affect our lives debates shouldnt be treated as entertainment events

make politics boring again
that was bad   newsom did well  but literally every topic was framed to fit the gop narrative   it was 2 on 1 and newsom still had real substance and points   mr high heels just talking about individual people that told him something
so you can out trump trump

lol oh no he didnt bring up his poll s in his own state 

down 41 pts lol
brilliant move by the dems having one of their best speakers humiliate not only desantis but the republican party in front of fox viewers
lmao at the people saying newsom isnt doing good  fox news has an ultra conservative fanbase  any liberal or moderate can see right through the 2 on 1 stuff going on  it doesnt make newsom look bad in the slightest  it shows he is willing to go into enemy territory is debate even when they are working against him
why is hannity interrupting newsom
what was with these fked up ads on fox  the bible museum  a prayer line for billy graham  a shit ton of buy gold scams  man fox must really be hurting for advertisers  even car shield looked more professional than these 3am tv ads
newsom has been far better at spitting facts and actually debating ron just bad talks and insults both ron and hannity will keep cutting newsom off 10 seconds into his response obviously not an even playing field whether moderates and undecided voters are swayed by this is the bigger question
the california is dying narrative theyve built the last 510 years has been a huge success hardly any of it is reality

california is still awesome the problems plaguing california are nationalinternational issues directly caused by unchecked capitalism but they are amplified here due to overall attention an agenda and the fact california just has so many people so you can find anything if you look hard enough

the fact they paint this narrative like its gotham city is insanity
i saw highlights seemed like newsom was just out for blood im into it
governor newsom theres one thing we have in common neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024
newsom here are the empirical facts  
hannity enough lets move on
newsom doing well having to debate two people
did desantis just ruin his presidential hopes by becoming poop map meme guy more so than they already were
kayleigh mcenany said the feces map was a powerful moment and i laughed out loud
reading the news today

the debate did nothing to advance desantis  it got newsoms name out there more 

thats honestly about the only takeaways from the debate
gavin ate the go go boot wearing meatball alive which wasnt unexpected

in 28 he will run for potus and win
newsom giving masterclass in debating rightwingers
its like watching a 1st grader who thinks burping in your face is cool compete with a college ivy league student
didnt florida lie about or not even report deaths
was really hoping newsom would take his shoes off and go ron this is how tall i am what do you say kick off those heels and show us how tall you are
honestly destantis was in a needtowin situation coming into this debate and fox news gave every opportunity for that newsom came in knowing it was a 2v1 and still holding his own pretty well 

thus destantis is losing he need a total victory here and he cant get it fox hannity conservatives and destantis can spin this all they want but destantis isnt getting a knock out  a break out the media can say whatever they want but this is proof that destantis campaign is dying
if americans didnt know gavin newsom they do now
conservatives are out in droves within this thread  newsom is absolutely destroying both of them
newsom has that jfk level charisma
these ads are like a completely different universe than the rest of cable tv
this is the first time ive watched a show on fox news in probably over 20 years the commercials are really weird
but why
so wait a minuteits hosted by fox and sean hannitynewsome going in the lions den huh
my first thought was that newsom is going to wipe the floor with him
oh god what a stupid take hannity is basically stating that everyone from china and iran is a terrorist
always so weird to me how republicans think the average voter hates teachers unions every major strike the public has their back its almost like people like public school educators and the organizations that support them
hannity is horrible the only good thing is that hes so obviously in the tank against newsom that it makes newsom look better
when the desantis campaign started to flounder i really thought it was some combination of desantis having a bad message to focus on and republican base voters rallying around trump postindictment  i said before that if desantis had run as a republican who would basically be trump but actually interested in the minutiae of governing things like hurricane response something that hes actually been not terrible at especially compared to trump thered be a pretty open lane for him in the republican primary  but then he went and indulged the fox news outrage of the week at nearly every opportunity and it absolutely crashed his candidacy

now i think hes just an awful politician bailed out by population trends in florida and having charlie fucking crist as an opponent and that any republican wouldve had the electoral success that hes had in florida if not more  this guy just isnt it
desantis cant control his fucking face he might actually be a lizard alien in a skin costume
why is that fatheaded oaf allowed any where near that type of role i mean he is basically a sewage spewing propaganda tool for the right
i dont want to give fox news the eyeballs ill catch the highlights after the fact though it would be fun to watch newsom mop the floor with desantis
as an unfortunate resident of fl but born and raised in ca newsom is a fucking rockstar to me i simply cannot wait to vote for him for potus

and ron lmao what a choad
holy shit hannity needs to shut the fuck up what is this
this is an ambush disguised as a debate
desantis was pro lockdown and pro vaccine but changed his tune when it wasnt politically acceptable in his party
this is the most biased debate ive ever seen 

newsome cant speak entire thoughts even though hes the most coherent person between him and desantis

but i will say newsome can handle the double team better than most
i know they fear newsom because of all the conservative comments in here usually they just retreat to their crazy sub
why desantis is debating the one person that isnt even running for a position in the white house baffles the fuck out of me

he should just quit completely he has absolutely no chance on the national stage and he is debating on a specific platform of the media where the audience he is speaking to are those whose minds are already made up about their nominee
hannity is debating newsom also
the questions are insane biden is old and stupid thoughts
good lord hannity is such a slimeball gavin cant ask questions but ron can this is absolute bullshit
lets stop and acknowledge that rons been walking around all night with a poop map in his pocket
deleted
lol desantis didnt want to stay
its insane to me desantis agreed to this
over at rconservative theyre claiming desantis swept the floor with newsome interesting reality they have over there
desantis will do anything to not govern the state a florida worst governor ever
desantis is waaayy out of his league here holy shit lol
one of the terms of the debate should have been having to do it barefooted
damn ron got laid out by newsom that question to him on when is he going to drop out so nikki haley can have her shot at trump was fckin brutal
deleted
desantis needs training wheels to debate like he needs boot risers now imagine you swap hannity and his graphs  leading questions for rachel maddow and newsom would have obliterated him that setup so cooked for meatball ron it wasnt even funny 
california failing due to newsoms leftist policies 

 5 economy in the world baby
i live in florida and ron desantis absolutely closed everything from march and on he opened up for 2 weeks in june i remember because i went to a bar and covid sky rocketed and we closed again like why is he denying this 
ive already seen two people here claiming to be democrats but ragging on newsom who are extremely active in far right subreddits lol
i thought hannity was supposed to be the moderator not part of the debate
desantis calling newsom slick and slippery and then immediately licking his lips like a reptile lol
desantis every time after newsom gives an incredibly specific number on an issue just more lies
throughout this whole debate the one thing that has continually floored me over and over again is holy shit these are the commercials that fox news viewers have to watch ive literally lost iq points during the breaks
hannity just gave desantis an escape route didnt he
lol desantis ran away
desantis broke out the creeper smile tonight
the only positive thing ron said all night was how beautiful california is
hah fox showed a chart labeled with leaked cbp data as a talking point in the debate lmao solid journalism right there where the points dont matter and the facts are made up
im sure sean will be totally impartial and not show bias at all during this debate as a moderator
s
oh fox news is mediating im sure itll be completely and accurately fact checked and they wont let any dog whistles come throughat least call them out on them
newsom is running for 2028  the debate was to raise his profile and torpedo desantis  although desantis is currently getting his teeth kicked in if trump dies it his highly likely that desantis will be the front runner gop is not backing a woman or an indian and certainly not the fat man

desantis was looking for some kind of win this one with assistance from the refs and his mom still couldnt pull it off
fox really fed desantis to newsom on their programming theyre definitely in on haley huh
ron seemed coked out lots of shifty eyes licking lips
predictably terrible moderation from hannity and desantis did what he always doestry to look like a big boy while balancing on his stilts and remembering to make loud words  newsome did what he had to to not get drowned out but no one comes out looking good in these zero standards fox debates
newsom dominated hes impressive in how aggressive he is in hiting desantis on facts democrats need that kind of energy and intelligence

desantis did a bit better than i expected  but it was all anecdotal stories garbage

i also fucking love how desantis says its cheaper to live in florida even with inflation here in st catharines canada where i live its cheaper to live than in florida and afford basic necessities or go to a restaurant and we have single payer healthcare a very liberal policy also other government programs by liberals

newsom won id like to see him as the dem nominee in 2028
did hannity just imply that alternative energy isnt valid because it cant replace oil in the next 6 months
this is basically desantis hannity vs newsom debate every single question was loaded and hannity saved desantis multiple times heck it seems desantis knew the questions and brought up a poop map with him on  national tv
a summary for those who missed it
questions

desantis everything in your state is great can you explain the policies you have implemented to make it so great 

newsom your state is shit can you tell us why it is so shitty

it was similar to have you stopped beating your wife all night for newsom who continually got talked over by desantis whereas when newsom talked over desantis he was called out
i was really hoping that newsome instead of a bottle of water for refreshment would bring a pudding cupand a spoon
ron looks so uncomfortable when he smiles 

he should stop doing that
newsom is here to promote biden and i think hes doing a solid job not sure what im missing reading these comments
hannity this is a debate about states

hannity is joe biden lying to the american people about immigration
im pretty sure ron desantis was given the questions before this started lol
desantis 
oh man newsom won that one
newsom starts saying something meaningful aaanndd we have to go to break
you can disagree without being disagreeableruth bader ginburg

newsome has that ability like no drama obama his nickname by his staff during his illinois senatorial campaign in 2004 ron just comes across as hot and bothered all the time
if anyone is wondering why theres so much anti gavin newsom circle jerking and hate going on just check their profile 

lots of people from rconservative and rrepublican 

which is fine debate means to have both sides at the table 

but realize some people might come to the table in bad faith and just turn the comments into a youtube comment section
is hannity moderating or playing tagteam jesus christ
all ron has are random anecdotes that cant be verified
omg biden experiencing cognitive decline did they forget about trump jesus christ
okay so rons entire defense is biden bad californians leaving in droves liar liar liar
newsom should just focus on debating hannity hannity is taking the bait and ive never seen more backandforth between a debator and moderator
desantis issue has been not having enough time to talk during the gop debates and im seeing the same emerge here only problem is that newsom pivots from debating hannity and brings desantis back into the conversation
did ron really pull a poopmap out of his pocket lmao
desantis is so embarrassing
hannity gives ron as much time as possible gives newsom almost no time at all
i appreciate your wife
lol desantis looked like he wanted to die when hannity asked if he wanted more
desantis had to poop
what the fuck  what happened to the debate 
ah yes mcenany even kindly highlighted the high point of desantis speech the personal anecdote with no evidence
to paraphrase chris christie were gonna be callin ya ronald duck
what this does do simply shows desantis doesnt have the temperament to be president trump never had it and desantiss decision to be donald trump iii is killing him the orange jesus will whip out more roger stone dirt on him and has the threat of even damaging the republican or excuse me the trump party of florida
theres a lot of comments on here about why did they do this and alluding to each of their personal ambitions

but im going to put my unpopular opinion out there id like to see more of these head to head debates from governors with vastly different policies theres a huge difference between how red state and blue states are being run and id like their leaders to debate why and the results of it i dont really care what their personal ambitions are or whos party is doing what

unfortunately that isnt quite what we got because it was on fox news they really tried to set desantis up with softballs and rather than debate their own policies they debated bidens policies
damn newsom smoked his ass
hannity debating with newsom now newsom taking both of them down
hannity keeps cutting newsom off not a fair debate
desantis looks like a baby in a adult costume he also has homelander eyes so weird
id like a breakdown of how many times hannity cut newsom off compared to the open mic night he hosted for desmugness
lol ron quit
can someone make a meme of desantis holding up the poop sheet with a title this is how my campaign is going
desantiss weird fake smile on stage was by far the most cringiest thing i have ever seen
newsom shouldve said no i am not running for president because im busy serving my state as governor something that ron is failing to do since he changed the law in his state allowing him to stay governor while running for president
please call 911 every time desantis talked about people leaving ca i took a shot
i cant believe desantis actually pulled out a piece of paper with shit on it
pretty sure this debate doesnt change anything fox news watchers will think ron won because he talked over newsom a lot
desantis doesnt have a political future
the opening statement that newsom made was the only thing you need to hear  fox hanity and the gop just got embarrassedeven without trumps help
california governor newsom debates florida governor desantis and sean hannity

ftfy
someone actually survived a late term abortion so lets make them illegal  ron desantis
i dont think ron agreed to stay he should drink his water awkwardly if he wants to be rescued
newsom should be the democrat front runner wow can he debate
the funniest part of this is that its fox news so of course they are going to say desantis wonbut this is a lose lose for him  they did this all on fox news if newsome convinced anyone at all in that audience thats hes worth listening to he already won  he had nothing to lose vs desantis who was playing with home field advantage and rigged refs lol
it appears that gavin newsom wiped the stage with some more ron earlier tonight
this debate did ron no good  glad someone newsom was up there confronting misinformation if i was biden id sue fox regarding cognitive decline leading question
hannity mr desantis what color is a red fire truck 

mr newsome give him time to answer please
why you cant debate fascists it doesnt work because they dont have a consistent ideology they lie constantly and they use hypocrisy as a weapon rather than as a weakness

you dont debate fascists you do something else with them
 weve never been this divided

you had a large part in that dividing sean do fuck off
got a couple of desantis staffers in here posting how well rhonda is doing 
gotta love how hannity is saving desantis every moment hes under fire
unbiased moderator
newsom should ignore hannitys loaded hitjob statistics questions and just say what he thinks about the topic in fact i think thats what hes doing now
so is hannity going to interrupt desantis at some point
ca air quality is a lot better than it was in the 60s70s80s

part of the reason is better gas dont know the exact words due to polluting less

i like clean air
i expected a ton of bias but wow every stat they put up is to hurt newsom and help desantis and so are the ways the questions are framed and when hannity decides to interrupt lol comical
who the fuck thought it was a good idea for desantis to do this  newsom has not dog in the national fight and it costs him nohting to hit him hard
why cant desantis smile like a human
newsom is about to embarrass and humble desantis
they arent even trying to be fair with the questions
desantis is so freaking weak
gavin just toetagged ron good grief pack it up ron told him he is trolling 
fentanyl deaths skyrocketed during trumps term doubling from 20172020 why wasnt desantis pounding his fist then 

how did it climb that high if the borders were locked down under trump and republicans say the open borders under biden are the reason for the spike

i like how the questions are formed like in the next six months what could replace fossil fuels lol what a joke fox news
ron desantis entire career is gonna lead up to him getting on a debate stage with trump and trump dismissively going youre such a meatball ron and then disappearing forever
 ronrelax
damn newsome struck a nerve there lol
okay what is with desantiss obsession with feces
remember when desantis paid to fly a bunch of undocumented immigrants to marthas vineyard
if nothing else newsom can say he got fox news to change its programming
and they disappear while offcamera without showing them shaking hands or side by side just like at the start meatball wanted to bail offcamera to avoid the height disparity how pathetic i wonder if there will be any pictures of them together
httpstwittercomacynstatus1730422059975455212httpstwittercomacynstatus1730422059975455212

this is the most awful desantis has ever looked hes clearly panicking the entire time that water bottle sip says it all
deleted
newsom is crushing this topic at least
wants to ask about gun violence

notices florida has a higher gun death rate than california 

focuses on mass shootings instead
there hasnt been a single question critical of florida every single one is hannity and desantis dunking on california
wow gavin rocks
your own lyin eyes lol i still cant accept desantis is an actual human being
ron gets an extra 90 seconds are you freakin kidding me
mike pence with his fly and ron desantis with his poop map whats next toilet paper ring after using the bathroom
ratings boom for fox a positive for newsome and an embarrassing last gasp for air by desantis it was painful to watch as bugs bunny would say a battle of wits with an unarmed desantis man i almost dont get it just a year ago this guy was riding high and since his announcement has gone anywhere but forward
smart move for newsom desperate move for desantis
little ronny is just so bad with a microphone in front of him  every time he speaks he loses supporters from sheer embarrassment
leading questions strike again

one word answes only bidens mental degradation is bad for the country yes or no
if i were desantis i would just give up after that what a brutal massacre of his entire being
can ron use any argumentative strategy other than i talked to some guy and he said
why arent they letting newsom speak god damn
hannity is fishing so hard
ffs these commercials were living in the shittiest of times
i love how at the beginning hannity is like im not part of this debate only moderating 


that didnt last long sheesh
shop without the political pressure 

wasnt aware there was pressure when i went to shop at wegmans lol
hanity lets desantis go on another rant and tells newsom he cant reply what a fucking joke
boom im glad someone finally corrected desantis on his purposeful mispronouncing of kamala harris name
i just want to say this about abortion

miscarriages happen tragically often and they dont always happen in the early part of a pregnancy that means that the body is either fully or partially formed with bones and there is no way for the body to deal with that except through an abortion

if that dead baby is left inside the body it will kill the mother and if through a miracle she survives she might never have another child again without an abortion
this is the most unhinged and insane thing i have ever seen on tv
i think we can create a job with someone muting the mic of the governor not called on
i think ron needs to get better at debating he needs better facial expressions more self control less interruptions one of these days trump is gonna show up to one of these debates and call him meatball ron and hes gonna cry i know it
ron relax

ron gets quiet
desantis has no chance anyways
i think ron smeared his own poop on that pic in the car on the way over
dont know why hannity didnt just debate newsom lmao
imagine having a moderator this favorable and still struggling so hard in the debate
i dont care for either of these guys but newsom is clearly outclassing desantis just more intelligent and coherent
dude they let ron desantis bring props and he still got shown up  thats impressively bad debate performance
lmao at this fair and balanced postdebate panel
i loved how newsom cut off rons meatballs with the book banning answer i swear ron looked ashamed when it was brought into light
hannity carried pudding ron so much i thought hed throw his back out im not a fan of newsom but that debate was ridiculously lopsided

desantis should have done even the barest of research and the way newsom bent over backward for pge to keep them out of trouble would have popped up would have been an easy point i hate desantis but halfway through that drubbing i started feeling uncomfortable watching
it speaks volumes about the foolishness of desantis that he even agreed to do this an unforced error of dukakislevel proportions
forget about the facts for a moment  desantis comes across as whiney  newsom is one well spoken man  those things matter
fox news is a joke
newsoms not wrong after mass shootings why the fuck shouldnt we crack down on guns
it cannot be understated how skewed this debate is in favor of desantis these charts are wild
newsom got rons ass on that jan 6 comment
newsom shoulda brought up that abortion rates have increased the year after roe was overturned

httpswwwaxioscom20231024abortionincreaseroewadestateban
insurance rates in florida are not doing well at allthis is a lie
i do think hannity would do slightly better than desantis in the primaries maybe a solid 3rd place or so in iowa
the gaslighting by republican talking heads on social media is proof at how scared they are of real facts and talking points
desantis brings up a self portrait this is human feces
thats gonna be a meme template right there with the shit map
hey get me a poop map no make the shapefile blobs bigger and browner so it covers the entire map
i feel like reagan is like jesus in republican politics theres this caricature that republicans cling to that is completely divorced from what reagan actually did  and it makes the democratic reagan bombs of well actually that much more brutal
its funny how desantis is the one that flies undocumented people around for free lol
youre calling him antisemitic what the actual fuck lmao where did he get that fron
hannitys questions to desantis how did you feel about the weather today
other commitments lmao
newsom is probably 2028 nominee and he is already out here dropping bodies
california has 39 million residents
florida has 21 million 

in 2020 50700 californians became florida residents
22100 floridians became california residents

thats 013 of californias residents moving to florida compared to 010 going this other way

so anytime desantis says californians are fleeing for florida thats what it means 3one hundredths of a percentage point
dude now the lonely fox news moms that were already going to vote behind their husbands backs are now going to back newsom hoooly shit hahaha
gavin newsom could definitely win the dem vote at this point hes got the name recognition and the gusto to back it up although it sounds like he has no intentions to run in 2024 his struggle will be that he is indefinitely tied to california republicans anywhere in the us despite not seeing a shred of evidence believe california to be this liberal hellscape a possibility of a california governor as president might drive them to the polls out of sheer spite
i love that newsome used his mind and wit to battle the double team of hannity and ron ron was so handicapped that he had to bring props
i would watch this but then id have to hear desantis talk
for someone not hearing about this until now  why in the world are these two debating
soooo sick of hearing about all the people desantis claims he talks to
hannity needs to stop desantis  let newsom speak
whenever its brought up how bad desantis is polling against trump he smiles like hes hiding bursting out in crying
ron grinding the absolute fuck out of his teeth is really something
religious nutters need to let people do what they want with their bodies
watched 5 minutes sick of political professional wrestling  all bullshit and confirmed that desantis is an asshole  unwatchable
trump cant form coherent sentences hes been this way for years
this moderator has to go back to 1968 under a completely different contexual period to bait newsom laughable
lmfao lightning round
what i wouldnt pay to drop kick sean hannity holy shit what an irritating prick
ron carries photos of human feces in his suit at all times
poop map ron
 can hannity be more biased
i cant wait to see some good memes about rons poop map in the next couple days
was ron using a prop to attract expence supporters or was that his revised campaign plan
lmao ill take biden at 100 over you anytime
i cant believe i was so naive to believe hannity would conduct this debate without extreme bias
newsom is going for the fucking jugular with the campaign questions holy fuck
for all the people saying hes avoiding specific questionsnewsome doesnt get a lot currently out of this his sole purpose right now is to be a cheerleader for biden so hes going to shift the topics as he needs to
lol desantis pulled out
hahaha desantis got scared
i cant find a youtube of the entire debate just clips anyone find one or have a link to it
i have no intention of watching this live but i look forward to the clips i expect ill see all over twitter tomorrow which ironically will be about the time gavin will be pooping out little chunks of meatball ron left over from this event
its a fox news interview hosted by hannity theres zero chance this will be fair in any way shape or form
love it newsom bringing the nuance florida incredibly regressive tax system
stark contrast like jfk vs nixon one has charisma one does not desantis is at best a regionallocal politician he in not ready for primetime and has already far exceeded his small potential by barely beating andrew gillum by 30k votes out of over 8 million in 2018 he got lucky but his luck has run out no one likes this guy
hannity doesnt seem interested in any critique of florida
desantis touting floridas education you mean the same education that wont acknowledge gay and filters books
its a joke  faux news is a terrorist organization
ron has the most unsettling transition from smile to resting face it makes my skin crawl
ol high heels is gonna get newsomd
for some reason i just cant take fox news chart and text graphics seriously
thought newsome was strong on the different lgbtq ideologies but was interrupted by hannity
yeah i dont think 12 year olds are fleeing their home state without their parents knowing and getting a sexchange surgery
no way florida is 1 in education
checking that usnews chart florida is only 1 in higher education which is not what the debate topic was about
were all born on this planet and we should all have rights to do what we want with our bodies no one else should have a say
my grandma was a toilet baby
im not a potted plant here  hannity no youre not you are the person debating newsom
desantis isnt comfortable in his own skin he looks like a marionette with an exceptionally painful smile painted across his face

interestingwild how the establishment neoconneolibs are propping up two puppets nobody wants when we literally have an incumbent and a loser named trump
our homeless population is going down in florida



because were shipping them away lol
desantis brings props
desantis over here like carrot top
do right wingers think san francisco takes up the whole state
printed human feces map lmao desantis
overtime but hannity is out of charts
desantis is once again just failing to go above and beyond or even close to it down 40 points you have to break out at some point but hes just such a weirdo lol
its between this the third gop rebate this year and the trumpclinton debate for the worst thing ive ever watched
when all else fails pull out the human feces map
this is a great way for newsom to step into the spotlight and make himself known to more voters  whatever he has planned hes laying the groundwork for future ambitions
fact check the heartbeat does not start at 6 weeks republican propaganda
so anyone know what the hell the point of this debate was lmao
there are no abortions happening at the moment of birth im so tired of hearing this bs line
hannity  its going to be softballs for desantis
newsom isnt running in 2024 hes past the deadline to file to run in a lot of states and hasnt really put together necessary campaign apparatus elsewhere hes done quite a bit to raise his profile in other regards but people who expect him to are wishcasting
keep in mind that desantis probably got all the questions beforehand so when he still shits the bed just know hes actually worse
love that gavin is coming across like a statesman while ron came in so hot and bothered
honestly though why did ron do this debate its a lose lose for him he needs to be attacking the front runner trump not debating newsom when he drops out of the 2024 race his name is finished he cant run in 2028 he should have waited for 2028 or attacked trump from the start
why arent they shutting ron up
this is impossible to listen to 
im done
desantis now the secondary republican debater
ron acting like young sibling liar liar liar
what the hell are these ads
easier to get a gun than vote as an exfelon from fl
chalk desantis up as once again another republican that seems to be rooting for a terrorist attack in america
well let the audience look into the numbers and decide  on fox news news yeah i think the chance of any typical fox viewers doing that is near zero
these are so cherrypicked to favor desantis
does desantis say anything other than people are leaving cali
hannitys directive was clear not a single unflattering stat graphic for florida
oh look another personal anecdote with literally no source desantis is really showing him 
god damn hannity shut the fuck up
newsom needs to call out hannity on whether the debate is with him or desantis
anyone that pays attention knows the us news rankings is bullshit
ah yes the winning the issue of abortion for these far right extremists
republicans base joe bidens cognitive decline on clips clay travis posts on x
ron should give hannity a back massage after this debate
ron look at this poop
poopgate is a serious issuepudding fingers
as a big america fan i wish newsom was more specific about florida but i do appreciate the kindness in his comments
santos at 6 am on fox and friends yikes hopefully his last interview as my congressman
bahahaha they couldnt go through with the overtime 

gavin bodied him
why would desantis agree to this newsom is not running and its not like he is good at debating or politics
i mean newsom at least didnt waste his time energy and money on what would have not been a sure thing compared to desantis who never really stood a chance and did waste all those things
dropped the mic with that one
mic drop
well sure this is correct in 3 months from now or less desantis will be dropped out of the republican primary newsom gets to claim some credit for aiding in the desantis campaign demise and the cachet within the democratic party for being a biden team player to utilize in the future either for his own national run or an influential voice in the party in deciding who should be elevated and backed
that is a solid opener
exactly the whole point is to separate the gop party and their voters whether he was successful or not is debatable but its a good strategy
it was hard to tell if newsom was debating desantis or hannity it was probably both the framing of these questions were clearly partisan they wouldnt touch topics like home insurance or how in florida theyre approving prager u material for classrooms the charts that hannity was showing were an easy google for totally different data than was shown this was an attempt at a 2 hour long gotcha and newsom managed to navigate it people who know the facts know that this was partisan hackery those who didnt were regular fox news viewers honestly though someone needs to do a full fact check run down of this debate i think it would be enlightening
what we have in common is that both of us wont be president in 2024
savage
and handled it well honestly
that is the attraction to a guy like newsom he is confrontational and does not shy away to argue against this idiocy head on he is also articulate and intelligent i hate to say this but he is also a decently handsome white man which will obviously give him big advantages in a general election
whose state is failing sure dude sure they are only like 30 of americas gdp or whatever the figure is so they are deffo failing
gavin beat hannity verbally on his own show and hannity is way better at this than desantis  should be fun
funny how conservatives dont recommend doing your own research when its about looking up whether anyone remotely to their left is telling the truth
newsom needs to address that he needs to say look it up they obviously cant both be true
you could show this proof to republicans but much like that show westworld all they would say is doesnt look like anything to me
the people that are leaving is because they are middle class in california but can be retired in a place like texas or florida most are older and have already taken advantage of the great universities higher income better jobs protections better healthcare and everything else the state has to offer and now want to retire early i know about 10 different people that are in this boat retire in california at 65 or retire in florida texas at 45 but once they leave it becomes almost impossible for them to come back its a one way trip because the property values in california outpace those other places
exactly friends of ours moved to alabama they sold their tiny 1000 sq foot home in ca and had enough for a 5 bedroom 3000 sq foot house on alabama somehow they are both teachers and wanted to make half their salary in alabama 

they claim they are happy but the last photo i saw of them celebrating their 1 year moveaversary it was in front of a boarded up piggly wiggly
harvard and yale educated attended
i can ivy league schools are insanely overrated nepotism networks
at this point i could honestly see newsom running a successful 2028 presidential bid  he doesnt back down to corrupt culture war charlatans like ron  he backs up what he says with facts and he sticks to the actual policy issues

you can disagree about his policy decisions in a lot of instances but he is an effective communicator who backs up his claims
hes in this weird position where he cant appear too smart or draw on his ivy league background because his base hates learning
like 3 times now on different topics its hilarious props to newsom for doing this on fox
i liked the this is a lightning round
and water is wet  hannity has no credibility outside of fox news watchers  which is why  anybody outside their fanbase can see right through how bad it is
hes trying to save desantis from this trainwreck of a debate
newsom shouldve dropped a sean youre doing a better job debating me than my opponent
the advent prayer tracking app commercial was straight up odd
i didnt watch tonight but the last time i flipped past fox news in a hotel there was an ad on for patriotic generators  the generators for true patriots or something like that it was like staring into the abyss for a brief moment and the abyss is wild
its like a whole different world
its like an alternate universe
is tom selleck still pushing reverse mortgages
its not like florida even has the full numbers ron made sure of that
dont forget including robberies with the murder and rape rates to make florida seem reasonable
i hope youre kidding because yeesh
they really do
hence they arent allowing him too
that means they fear him
wasnt supposed to be a debate in a sense more of trying to find a corneredgavin gotcha moment and he fucking owned them honestly amazing lmao
every single t ime
haha anytime he gets going hannity chimes in
yeah and prior to that quip there was a long piece of desantis trying to paint newsome as a biden lover and his response was basically yeah i am
god id kill for a president who could just drone on for hours about marginal tax rates or some shit
what did newsom expect going on fox news though they were never going to be balanced
bodybag 
dems didnt make any such decision this wasnt sponsered by the dnc this was purely gavins decision which i agree was a very good decision
newsom is fucking crushing him what are these idiots talking about
because hes a twit and still mad newsom made him look dumb on his show
says a lot about their core audience doesnt it  snake oil salesman and nonsense pedlars actually pay millions to put these messages in front of their viewers because their viewers are the ones that send money to nigerian princes that promise them millions
or thats just what their viewers are truely consumers ofremember many are easily manipulated or gaslighted by a shiny object if put in front of them
fox has always been 90 money for gold ads
i find it absolutely wild california is absolutely amazing young people everywhere being healthy florida is just a flat swamp filled with elderly people talking shit about how old biden is

my mom lives in naples and took me to a grocery store that has a stand out front selling trump  fuck joe biden shirtsyes there is a my pillow outlet inside
thanks for saying it moderation seems to point questions one way
i heard he keeps a poop map because he likes to eat fresh poop
do i even want to know what nonsense shes talking about
lmao that chick is still around
assuming elections will be allowed at all in 28 lets hope
that is correct florida death rates should be much much higher than reported
florida had people arrested for revealing that desuckass was fudging his covid numbers  desantis should be sued at least
yup and then they crucified the woman who tried to post the facts
yeah and disney was shutdown for covid in florida so desantis was flat out lying earlier
they did if you visited fl and on day one of your trup caught covid there then got worse then went to a fl hospital then died there they wouldnt count you because you arent a resident 

which is fucked because florida gets so many tourists plus snowbirds tons of people live in florida but arent permanent residents so they wouldnt count during the pandemic my mother and sisters stayed in florida for 6 months but they wouldnt count if they died
i think all this proves is that if somehow he does get the nomination he is gonna get demolished in a presidential debate when the moderators arent as obviously partisan
they left their sub to come here and comment trump tweet style
 conservatives are out in droves within this thread

when that happens to rconservative they make their posts flaired only like cowards
absolutely 

tell me a single memorable thing that ron has said literally nothing at all
hes destroying the shills in the threads too
and that wins elections
newsom is way quicker on his feet than desantis and more personable he proved that much tonight
thats because no respectable brands want to be associated with this network
i turned on fox for 5 minutes and i was speechless at the ads the knock off square company whoever produced that ad should be embarrassed
oh did you get the billy graham prayer number too
newsom is jockeying to be the fillin should father time finally come a knocking on joes door

desantis is desperate to stay relevant 

boom debate
desantis has accepted he will not win this year thats just reality but he knows that newsome is positioning himself for 2028 the same way ron is ron isnt getting the ticket this year but hes the number 2 pick of nearly every single person who has trump as their number 1 that means massive potential

so hes trying to get ahead of the game
good on him the people who watch hannity and fox in general need to hear what an actuallyintelligent rational human sounds like

they may not like it but they need to hear it
hannity shouldnt be allowed to do anything in a serious capacity hes a probably dishonest and disingenuous person
eh sort of  its not like he hasnt done that before his ex is don jrs nutso wifegirlfruend  the screaming banshee and trump singer songwriter turned tv political expert kimberly guilfoyle
desantis hasnt really done well in any debate hes been in so expectations for him have to be low  in the toilet low
intellectually he will but conservatives will think desantis won as long as the right buzzwords come out of his mouth
right that was a real racist segment there
to a casual viewer why is he is biased against him  he must be worried about him
i mean he is basically a sewage spewing propaganda tool for the right

very few are not
thats all the right is interested in
they love a sewage spewing propaganda tool just not this one
once desantis started to try and out trump trump then he just started to be a nightmare for a governor

he killed more people with his covid policies of completely open with no mask instead of open but masked he has done nothing for our insurance markets and his antiimmigration stance is just incredibly bad for business here in florida
you can watch on david pakmans youtube i had same thought as you lol
his composure and strength here really shows hes likely to be a top contender in 2028 three big names to watch are newsom beshear and whitmer i really do think one of them has the best shot to take the reins
hannity realizing his side is getting creamed so as the smarter more charismatic conservative with a microphone stepping in to help  


ive flushed things more charismatic and intelligent than hannity btw
a blind man could see this from a mile away  newsom knew what he was doing
and the people on fox were like i give him credit for coming into a hostile environment he gets 10 pts from me like a few minutes before it started lol
hes doing fine all things considered but this is a fake debate they setup every single question and answer them with massive bias ahead of letting anyone talk
i cant believe they backed out of rconservative for a few minutes and their mutual edging
desantis isnt really in the running either so at least they have that in common
thats like 15 people though
they are saying that he didnt answer any questions directly
it really takes a lot to be a worse governor than what rick scott was but ronnie high heels was up to the task
what about big white boots
thoughts and prayers for your liver you madman
dont worry gavin was fact checking in real time
he does that when hes against the ropes which is basically all the time
considering the home field advantage desantis had  he looked terrible hannity had to come to his defense a number of times i thought newsom did a great job given the circumstances
he will be awesome still cant believe who his exwife is though what happened to her i worry theres some sort of weird baggage thatll come out i cant imagine anything would stop me from voting for him short of a trumpesque scandal
newsom had a bad hand biased moderating and pulled off a slight win
yeah it was one of the dumbest questions ive ever heard
it was absolutely one sided it wasnt fair cherrypicking data that already asserts your predetermined opinion newsom got bullied hard wasnt allowed to debate shouldve been far fewer topics and much longer time to actually have a discussion what happened to discussions
everytime newsome made a solid point hannity piped up that it was time to move on  personally i would have loved an answer from desantis regarding a national abortion ban but clearly hannity thought that wasnt an important issue
it was weird that more ron brought a map of everywhere hes pooped
newsom was winning and they had to end desantiss suffering
thats the republican strong point have a strong stance on things that have no evidence
yeah that was certainly a lie by hannity   newsom clearly said he wanted to stay right before the break
sociopaths often have to mimick real emotions they see from others and its usually pretty apparent
and the bizarre head wobble thing we are sure hes actually human right
leaving in droves i tell ya
i watched every second of the debate that is what i will remember how could he not realise that that will be the takeaway from the night trying to figure if it replaces the fly
i agree the fox news base is the base and desantis was speaking to them in the way they absorb information which is without nuance and with repetition and anecdotes and other populist speaking methods newsom won to the reasonable desantis to the culture war base
that swig when gavin was talking about him banning books he looked like he could explode i loved how much disdain gavin had for him theres no room for courtesy for people like ron desantis
the republican party has convinced themselves that biden will dropout and newsom will be the democratic nominee
as an escaped defective disney animatronic he has some handicaps in that regard
this is basically his campaign running this newsoms just doing this for shits and giggles really
was driving around for work this week as saw a house with desantis for president signs inside a cage to keep them from being stolen
hannity is a fucking joke couldnt do serious journalism if his life depended on it
yeah i actually peeked over at the conservative subreddit and a lot of them are acting like this was a beat down because gavin was avoiding giving them soundbytes
he didnt in that debate either got wiped
makes me respect newsom more
i loved when newsom  talked about bidenomics and said desantis was celebrating  about the money given to florida desantis looked like he was malfunctioning
man over on fox theyre acting like newsome got destroyed lol
reagan is worst president in american history
stop we dont do facts in politics rhetoric and conjecture only
literally when fox is gloating that florida had 3 less school shootings then cali when cali is basically double the population 
ironic isnt it that reagan was also a governor of california
i didnt catch it live but found the entire debate httpsyoutubeeyifd_ostpesivt2txkzgs3knhowc
turns out he sucks at softball too probably the high heel boots
if youre still watching fox youll see exactly why the hosts are falling over themselves praising ron with outofcontext soundbites right now
not his money  just other peoples
sounds like politics
newsom was always going to run for president what do you think the whole recall effort was about a couple years ago actually recalling him of course not the republican party knew from day one it was going to fail but that didnt matter because what they really did was set a proverbial political trump card up something they could drudge up to smear him with when he inevitably runs 

newsom was so hated in radical liberal blue woke california that they actually got it to vote to remove him

every right wing pundit outlet rag and candidate will run with that the moment he declares his candidacy for president hoping people cant remember the details or that theyre counting on you being a total moron as well because if you did youd remember is was lead by the gop and failed in overwhelming fashion with something like 1 of the entire states electorate

newsom terrifies them because nothing sticks nothing tarnishes him at all there is nothing they can do to hurt him or stop his rise tonight jesus they made this guy a god damn rockstar he walked into their house with their guy and he smacked him around and did it with a smile
was it enough to make the average fox viewer lose at least a little faith in desantis and gain maybe a teeny bit of respect for newsom
100
thats whats amazing  california alone has the fifth largest gdp in the world there are only 4 countries with a higher gdp than ca as a state
do your research basically means the rest of the world is wrong and the one source they cite like some 20 sub youtube channel is the correct one they get frustrated when people call out their cherrypicking and just default to that to end the conversation
you can led a horse to harvard but you cant make him think
newsom is on fox fairly often i think its part of his strategy
honestly its a stellar move the facts are on the dems side why not draw contrast and out those carrying water for the republican party in a venue where republicans will actually see it
would you like to switch with each other
all they need is a porn tracking tab on it and mike johnson is all over it
did anyone else see the commercial where the guy is trying to guy something and the pin pad starts asking who he voted for and if hes vaccinated

do these fucking lunatics thinks shit like that actually happens no one cares about vaccine status anymore unless you work for a hospital we dont even fill out the cards when you get a vaccine now
you can catch some of those during i believe college football games pretty sure ive seen the same on on fs1 its just absolutely batty and clearly tailored to doomsday preppers
it runs on ignorance and diabetes
does a trump get pissed on in russia
youve got one hes simply learned better than to do it a lot
that was literally hillary though shes an honesttogod policy wonk and could discuss fiscal policy for hours
i dont think hes mad about it he likes handing their talking points back at them  he recently took hannity to school so badly they became friends
people are so use to bad debates that they cant see a legit candidate if it hit them square in the face
with his fingers just like pudding
that explains the shit eating grin
they were talking about homelessness in san francisco then no exaggeration ron desantis pulled out a map of every place the discovery of human feces had been recorded in the streets san francisco deadass
unfortunately i cant forget that forced bizarre smile
plus hes tall and good looking that definitely helps like it or not people even subconsciously respond to appearance especially when it comes to voting for who they want as president
exactly  i wish dems would understand that up and down the ticket
iunno i live in the south and the desantis hate is almost as strong as the biden hate its crazy hearing people talk about him here trump really flipped the switch on him
yeah i think what democrats needsto do is to appear more on fox news that way they can open the audience mind at fox more
a lot of the questions were stacked against him
what we need in the white house is the worst poker face in history
discussions with knowledge and facts do not serve the fox news agenda
exactly those commercial breaks were well timed on newsoms time
man over on fox theyre acting like newsome got destroyed

they are reading off a script they wrote yesterday
theyre the network whos lawyers argue in court that they are not news theyre entertainment and no reasonable person would believe their crap and they are also the network who paid almost a billy to smartmatic for election lies not surprised
if ron desantis literally pissed himself on stage theyd be saying the same thing
theyre playing a game of heads i win tails you lose
its all it ever was going to be like i knew it was never gonna be impartial and was just gonna be a way for hannity to clip sound bites and continue feeding his followers the same horsecrap as always

complete and utter setup
i dunno is there any precedent for an up and coming politician to transition from governor of california to the white house
the economic power that just three states  ca tx ny  provide is mindboggling
its the buttigieg maneuver  go on fox news and make them all look dumb as fck by logically stating facts over and over while politely not tolerating bs
my dad got so mad he started shouting at the tv and turned it off i think he was just mad that the fox news 2v1 gangbang wasnt working out in their favor
the lunatics as in the viewers yes because thats the shit they are constantly fed

thats what we are up against a 247 goprussian propaganda machine which only exists to spew that shit
turns out no i didnt want to know
hes more than a pretty face thats what does it
eh i live in a deep red area theyre only against him because hes running against trump at the moment the second trump is out of the picture hes their guy policywise and stylewise
eh give it a few yearsmaybe after the death of trump  desatanis will be their only option and they will all of a sudden love him
im convinced thats how mayor pete got through to a lot of moderate republicans who voted for biden
that awkward fake forced smile is truly something else"
im mckay coppins author of romney a reckoning and staff writer at the atlantic ask me anything about my coverage of the senator,"hey reddit i spent the past two and a half years reporting on what senator mitt romney saw in his more than three decades in politics romney has made headlines in recent years for voting to remove former president donald trump from office and accusing fellow republicans of stoking the january 6 insurrection

based on hundreds of pages of personal journals that he gave me along with dozens of interviews with him and his inner circle i trace romneys rise through the republican party my biography takes readers behind the scenes of romneys private meetings with trump and dealings with barack obama joe biden george w bush and more i also detail his early life and his decision to ultimately retire from politics

i have reported extensively on american politics for more than a decade you can read an excerpt from my book herehttpswwwtheatlanticcommagazinearchive202311mittromneyretiringsenatetrumpmcconnell675306 purchase it herehttpstertuliacombookromneyareckoningmckaycoppins9781982196202affiliateatl347 and dive into my previous coverage herehttpswwwtheatlanticcomauthormckaycoppins

edit thank you everyone for your insightful questions i enjoyed giving you an inside look at my reporting process on senator mitt romney i will continue reporting on us politics as we approach the 2024 presidential election please feel free to send tips to  and follow my updates on twitter httpstwittercommckaycoppinshttpstwittercommckaycoppins","why is romney not putting up a very convincing fight against trumpism hes been critical yes but if he really sees the danger in it why is he not organizing more aggressively to fight trumpism
how does he live with himself

x200b

how mitt romney drove companies bankrupt raided pension funds and paid himself handsomelyhttpssandiegofreepressorg201207howmittromneydrovecompaniesbankruptraidedpensionfundsandpaidhimselfhandsomely
romney even takes credit for it eventually sorta but how on earth does he reckon with the fact that his state healthcare system implemented while serving as governor of massachusetts is the foundation for obamacare a system that he and his party campaigned on repealing for years the republican party choose romney as there presidential candidate one who was proud of bipartisan support for establishing a sort of universal healthcare in his state and for years outwardly criticized and spoiled efforts to advance universal healthcare legislation at a federal level 

how does romney reconcile with his parties abject opposition to one of his key political legacies in light of recent political shifts that romney seems like an outsider to a party that once thought he represented the most electable republican person must be incredibly jarring for this man how the hell does he just roll with it
i know the media has reported on some of the unfiltered thoughts romney had on some of his colleagues in the senate since religion was a big driver of romneys views i was curious if romney ever discussed his thoughts on some of his other mormon colleagues like mike lee famously compared trump to a book of mormon prophet tried to overturn election and jon huntsman jr early endorser of trump and from a rival mormon family
does he still have genuine hope for the future of the 1 his party and 2 this country why or why not
romney always seemed to understand the danger trump posed why did he try to get a role as secretary of state in the trump administration
when i teach college students about theories of representation we talk about the difference between the delegate model constituents elect candidates and expect them to promote constituent preferences directly in washington vs the trustee model constituents elect people with good judgement who do what they think is best in washington even if it occasionally goes against expressed constituent preferences whats your sense of how romney views his obligation as a politician to his constituents to himself to god etc how does he seem to balance these
what has romney said about how his own party sabotaged what became the aca it worked incredibly well under him in massachusetts
your book excerpt talks about senator romney being essentially an outcast within his own party that he cannot believe some of the things his colleagues are doing did he ever give a reason for staying a republican if the party is really against someone why be with them
many conservatives argue that romney was attacked too aggressively during the 2012 campaign and that this means democrats are responsible for trump on the other hand obama was attacked extremely viciously including by trump who romney allowed to be a surrogate 

do you get the sense that romney thinks the campaign against him was unfair if so what does he think the line is since he was clearly willing to use sharp elbows himself
serious question  has he expressed any remorse over taking the pensions of working people leaving them destitute while enriching himself
does he really keep binders full of women
will romney be considering running the 2030 or 2034 olympics if they are awarded to salt lake city
deleted
how did the senators journals inform the writing and interview process did you fully read the materials provided by romney prior to speaking with him and others on the record
how does senator romney want to be remembered as a politician
why when the county  the r party need as many good people in washington is mitt baling he should be leading and not being another mike pence and i ask the same of joe manchin
you and i hang in some of the same circles although im now an exmormon what is your take on why he recruited another mormon to quote this biography are there things you get that others wouldnt if so what are they
during his presidential campaign he never seemed to have peoplea crew to help him  he was a superficially attractive candidate good looking successful squeaky clean  but he never seemed to have anyone to help him get his message out  he was a serious candidate for the most powerful job in the free world and working for him and with him would be an honor for any political professional out there  but the whole campaign just never seemed ready for prime time  why not  why didnt he have better help
what do you think is the biggest misconception we have about romney was was the biggest revelation about romney you had while working on this project something that surprised youopened your eyes changed your mind
what is your earliest memory of meeting senator romney i remember meeting him when he was the lds stake youth president and i wonder if you have any early memories of him from before you went to byu and before he was governor if you did meet him before he was governor did he remember you from your days in ma
 during the campaign romney was seen was somewhat out of touch and uncaring about ordinary people  but there were a number of reports from people who expressed that romney was very caring and empathetic in his capacity as a church leader  playing up that side of him may have humanized him   but those were barely mentioned by the romney campaign   was the mormon stigma seen as so strong that romney didnt want to mention his work as a church leader
romneys criticisms of trump are often brushed aside from republicans who label mitt as a sore loser who is only saying these things because he couldnt win in 2012 i understand this is mostly just used to get people to not consider his criticisms but did romney ever say anything about being sour or upset that he didnt win and trump did im sure he feels that way to some degree but again i just dont know if hes ever talked about it
you wrote a fair bit about romney wanting to be part of few that actually legislate and that the majority of senators essentially play to the camera  did he give a sense of why more senators arent more involved in the actual work of legislating
does he plan to step away from politics all together if he voted for removal of trump does he believe that trump should not be president and  will he be working to stop a 2nd term for trump
partisanship and hate have allowed people to stay in their parties even when bad and ridiculous things happen in their own since he wants to save democracy is there any chance he will endorse voting for democrats until the republicans come back to sanity or is that a step too far
while governor of massachusetts did romney provide personal information of citizens to the mormon archives
where does he fall on the spectrum of morminism he strikes me as someone who might be very orthodox but i could also see him being very nuanced
hi can you tell us who romneys favorite ninja turtle is i think its donatello
having never spent much time in utah i was kind of shocked that it seemed like romney felt like a bit of an outsider there it was interesting to learn he ruffled feathers among the mormon elite did he ever discuss to what degree nepotism plays in the mormon church in salt lake i am super curious  how he felt about nepotism in general
excellent book ive reached out via email inquiring about an appearance on mormon stories with john dehlin if you would like to explore this further please reach out thanks again for your excellent research
i guess the premise of your question depends on how you define trumpism i think the things romney finds most dangerous about trumps brand of republicanism is the lying the corruption the authoritarianism the immoralityvulgarity the demonization of minority groups andon foreign policythe willingness to undermine american alliances and in his view retreat from the world i think romney has been fairly aggressive about opposing those things most famously he was the only republican senator to vote to convict trump during the first impeachment trial and he voted to convict him again during the second i also report in the book that in 2016 he worked extensively behind the scenes to get republican presidential candidates to coordinate in hopes of depriving trump of the necessary delegates to clinch the nomination that those efforts failed i think speaks more to a lack of effectiveness than a lack of aggressiveness 

what hes found over and over again is that most republican leaderseven the ones who tell him in private that they agree with his assessment of trumparent willing to sacrifice any of their own political capital to oppose him and the fact is that most rankandfile members of his party seem to like trumpism so hes fighting a losing battle
seriously he claims to be prodemocracy yet represents the antidemocracy antifreedom antiintellectual party how does he live with himself youre either prodemocracy oryoure not
bumped  id like an answer
republicans have no conscience so they can bypass moral conundrums pass go and collect 200
like don draper on a bed made of money
my book has lots of stories about his runins with mike lee and jon huntsman jr i think its fair to say he has a um complicated relationship with both of them romney and huntsman have a long and not always friendly historyromney felt huntsman broke a promise to him by endorsing mccain in 2008 over romney and then in the 2012 republican presidential primaries romney and huntsman ran against each other romneys journals from that period include frequent passing jabs at huntsman i write in the book that after huntsman boasted during the campaign that he would have a motocross track installed at the white house if elected romney mocked what he saw as the phony attempt to seem macho and wrote sounds to me like a confused metrosexual   
  
romney has tried pretty hard to get along with mike lee in the senate since they both represent utah and have to work together on several issues but based on my reporting romney feels like lee hasnt been nearly as dedicated to preserving a productive working relationship he feels lee  often goes out of his way to attack the bipartisan legislation romney has worked on and romney was outraged by lees work with the trump white house to overturn in the results of the 2020 election  in 2022 when lee was up for reelection romney declined to endorse lee who responded by going on tucker carlsons fox news show and begging romney for an endorsement while tucker ridiculed romney i quote romney telling a confidant maybe he just cant stand being in my shadow
i think hes pretty pessimistic about the republican party as long as trump is around and hes been asking himself some tough questions about just how deeply rooted the antidemocraticauthoritarian tendencies in the party arewill the worst elements of trumpism stick around even after trump is gone i know he hopes a new generation of republican leaders will come forward and help the gop rediscover a conviction in democracy but i wonder how much money hed bet on that happening some people who know him have told me hes fundamentally a pessimist i do think he still has hope for the future of the country but part of why he cooperated with me for this book is that he wants people to realize that the american project is much more fragile than we realize its not a given that american democracy will continue to thrive for centuries it takes work
i think that was a case where romney had two different motivations one slightly more noble than the other on one hand he told me he saw trumps election as an emergency and thought it was crucial that his administration have adults in the room he said he got phone calls from multiple former secretaries of stateincluding hillary clintontelling him essentially if he offers you this job you have to take it for the good of the country so that was the patriotic motivation but romney also admitted to me that his own ambition played a role i like being involved and being in the middle of things and having something important to do he told me its like you know i wanted to be president if you cant be president being secretary of states not a bad spot to come thereafter
this is a great question ive never discussed it with him explicitly in these terms but i think its fair to say hes leaned toward the trustee model as a senator when he was elected utah republicans knew what he thought about trump and so i suppose he could have taken that as implicit permission from his constituents to take the stand he did against the president but his approval rating has ping ponged quite a bit as a senator and his vote to convict trump for example was quite divisive in utahand very unpopular among utah republicans but in that case at least he felt his constitutional responsibility as a senator was to set aside political considerations and partisan prejudices and try to act as an impartial juror in the senate trial and he made the decision based on his best assessment of the evidence presented to him when he cast his vote romney cited the oath he swore before god at the beginning of the trial and actually got emotional as he explained how seriously he took that so i think its clear that he doesnt follow a strict delegate model in the senate
i asked him about this several times throughout our two years of interviews and it was something he seemed to be genuinely struggling with i remember once sitting at his kitchen table listening to him vent about some outrageous thing a prominent republican had recently done and then he just looked down at the table and almost seemed to say to himself its like how can i even associate myself with a party thats doing some of those things and saying some of those things the people who know him best say that he felt an obligation to try to stay in the party and steer it away from trumpism but five years into his senate term i think he recognizes hes effectively lost that fight he remains conservative on many issues so he doesnt feel like hed fit comfortably in the democratic party but he also finds that he agrees with democrats like joe biden on the issues he thinks are most importantdemocracy preserving the constitution etc by the time we had our last interview for the book earlier this year he was openly musing about leaving the party and starting something new
i dont think anyone runs for president without feeling a least a little like they were treated unfairly but i never got the sense that he was consumed by it maybe in the weeks after the election when he was feeling maximally sorry for himself he indulged in some wallowing and resentment but i dont think he buys the idea that because he was treated badly in 2012 republicans had no choice but to vote for trump in 2016 for one thing romney himself wasnt radicalized by his mistreatment nor were any of his five sons none of whom consider themselves republicans anymore
its too bad it got turned into a soundbyte that just sounded funny when it isnt something that should have hurt him at all a pair of threering binders filled with womens resumes as there was effort made to recruit women for government positions why is that bad

x200b

in 1918 the thenprophet of the church said

the ridiculous story about the red horse and the black horse and the white horse and a lot of trash that has been circulated about and printed and sent around as a great revelation given by the prophet joseph smith is a matter that was gotten up i understand some ten years after the death of the prophet joseph smith by two of our brethren who put together some broken sentences from the prophet that they may have heard him utter from time to time and formulated this so called revelation out of it and it was never spoken by the prophet in the manner in which they have put it forth it is simply false that is all there is to it

so why would romney support that when the church itself doesnt support it
yes i read the journals as soon as he gave them to me and highlighted portions that i thought might be useful as i wrote while i quote from them a handful of times throughout the book they were actually most useful for informing my interview with romney hed forgotten many of the stories he recorded there but i was able to jog his memory or in some cases press him to reconcile his current memory of an event with what he wrote at the time it was honestly a stroke of luck that hed been such a detailed diligent journalkeepermost of this stuff would have been lost to time if he hadnt written it down
i think these last few years have been an effort by romney to rewrite the ending of his political story he might have been remembered as a technocratic governor of massachusetts who ran two cautious calculating presidential campaigns and lost but now i do think hell be remembered for this final chapter of his career when he became a pariah in his own party essentially because he did what he thought was right
a lot surprised me when i started spending time with him for this book the first thing was that hes much funnierand even dishierthan people would probably assume he has a sort of puckish sense of humor and realizes how insane political life is and he likes to tell stories about all of it so i guess the first revelation was basically mitt romneypretty good hang   
  
once i dug into his journals i was surprised by how selfaware he is and how hard on himself he is watching him run for president you got the impression that he was this incredibly confident kind of staid and starchy guy assembled in a presidential candidate laboratory it was easy to assume he didnt have a very robust interior life as it turns out though he was often consumed with doubts about whether he was a fatally flawed candidate and often mused about whether he even wanted the job he would fixate on his own gaffes and disappointing debate performances and ruminate over all the people he would let down if he lost he was honestly kind of tortured in a way that i did not expect
when i was very young my family lived in belmont the same boston suburb he lived in and because we were both mormons we knew some of the same people but i have no memory of meeting him as a kid and the only story ive ever heard from parents about him from back then was about meeting him at a blockbuster video he recommended the mike myers movie so i married an axe murderer underrated movie so ive sort of been in his orbit since i was a kid but weirdly enough the first time i can recall meeting him was in 2019 when he arrived in washington as a senator and i profiled him for the atlantic
that was really vague    


the lds church voraciously eats up all kinds of public records for its genealogy library   yessiree they intend to baptize everyone  the dead offer less resistance  everyones grandma will wind up in their records
what are the mormon archives im asking as a member of the church
what hes found over and over again is that most republican leaderseven the ones who tell him in private that they agree with his assessment of trumparent willing to sacrifice any of their own political capital to oppose him

this is precisely why mr romney lost his presidential bid hes not a leader or certainly not behaving like one

and the fact is that most rankandfile members of his party seem to like trumpism so hes fighting a losing battle

mr romney as a potential presidential candidate is by definition not a rankandfile member of the party  hes supposed to be a leader not a follower

its precisely this sort of milquetoast fear of prom queen candidates like trump that i find puzzling  even now as trump is being slowly exposed for the paper tiger he is and at least some republicans knew he was all along that mr romney should either be sinking his teeth in or backing a candidate who will  one can only hope this at least happening through back channels
you know damn well we aint getting one
does he acknowledge his own responsibility in this mess  what does he feel about it
does he also acknowledge the young shining stars the gop is putting forward dont hold the same convictions on democracy hes hoping for all we see up and coming in the ranks are partisans like boebert greene and gaetz it seems if romney wants that coalition of young republicans he needs to put in effort to build it
were all so grateful for the civicminded adults who decided to join trump so they could tell us how appalled they were years later and once the book advance check cleared
thank you for the response
his first patriotic motivation just sounds like his second simple motivation for power with extra steps he will try to retcon himself as a deeply worried complicated statesman  who just wanted to be secstate for the good of the nation but that moment of dinner with trump exposed him as just another typical power seeker trying to suck up
thanks for your thoughtful response i finished the book earlier this week and thought it was excellent
he sounds like every other republican once they leave office  super concerned but not willing to admit they helped cause this or do anything to actually help
he remains conservative on many issues so he doesnt feel like hed fit comfortably in the democratic party

hes fitting into the republican party very uncomfortably by all accounts

how do we take anyone seriously about being committed to their values or arguing for giving up political capital when he wont do that by abandoning what the republican party has become outwardly
perhaps you could tell him about the forward party a major third party that is almost ready in all the states made up of former democrats and republicans who want to move forward together instead of left or right a true major third party could be really beneficial in the states especially if rankedchoice voting can become the norm
it comes off as performative like ticking a box like the quantity of female applicants has any meaning  in his attempt to show how much his campaign values women he wound up dehumanizing them

he could have said instead weve got hundreds of highly qualified women who have applied which is great  our campaign cant succeed without us respecting and embracing a female perspective
there are lots of things that members believe even when discredited by the church leadership just because the church doesnt support it doesnt mean he doesnt still believe it i personally know a bunch that still believe this even when i show them this quote
thank you im looking forward to reading your book its on my christmas list
i read your book and this was the most surprising revelation to me also really enjoyed the book thank you
so i married an axe murderer really is a massively underrated movie
former member here

i think hes referring to the personal info that the wards keep on you like contact info tithing records ordinations and callingsetc
here is one portal to the records

httpswwwfamilysearchorgenunitedstates
i mean trumpism didnt yet exist when he was the leader of the gop so he couldnt oppose it from that position 

he did vote to convict which is more than the rest of the gop 

but your points stand regardless
this reads the same way my stupid stepmother tries to sell essential oils and other mlm garbage
 especially if rankedchoice voting can become the norm

its not right now its republicans blocking that any efforts to spin up a 3rd party instead of being devoted to getting rcv is undermining the parties
it sounded terrible but i think he meant it the way you put it   when you are speaking extemporaneously it is really hard not say something at least a little awkward   im far from a romney fan but i give him the benefit of the doubt on that one
that is too bad i am also equally flabbergasted when members of the church support politicians who are corrupt or that believe election lies  my dad just texted me last night about that 2000 mules documentary that was debunked a few years ago and guess where he saw it a member of the church a neighbor shared the video with him and he was trying to tell me that there was illegal ballot harvesting and stuffing and things like that i shut him down quickly about how it was debunked and his geotracking evidence was easily explained why are so many gullible
former mormon herw i think you misunderstand the context of that

genealogy is extremely crucial to the mormon faith not getting into details because you have to actually do mental backflips in order to understand it but it is a mechanism by which they attempt to add legitimacy to the faith

familysearchorg is just genealogy website its not there to dox you
in the united states anytime someone brings up a third party they are just loudly declaring i dont understand american politics or math  


unless you have a valid path to replacing a party or a valid path of changing the way we elect officials its a nonstarter
good instinctshttpswwwpoliticocomnewsmagazine20230804andrewyangforwardparty00109231 

like them the forward party has promised to be a disrupter in the political space donors and volunteers are told nothing more than its new by design in reality the objective is staying in the newsfeed and wooing disenfranchised voters with empty promises of breaking the duopoly but offering no better alternative 

love the part where they couldnt even get yang to commit to not using this as a launchpad for a presidential run to prove this isnt a vanity project
does it just sharing what ive learned so far people like andrew yang are part of it feel free to learn about it its honestly a good alternative httpswwwforwardpartycomhttpswwwforwardpartycom

x200b

but the fact that its getting downvoted means youre right im clearly sharing information about it the wrong way or people are so stuck in their ways that they refuse to try something different
yeah its a mountain out of a molehill

the more lasting obamaromney meme for me is from the debate please proceed governor  i still use that one to this day
im out of the religion now so i wont say everything im thinking because its not productive i will say that i am also saddened and shocked at how easily they fall into gossiping weird interpretations of statementsscriptures and following trump who is literally against everything they stand for
understood  i just used that as an example   im confused about someone in the church not knowing about the archives
there are a few issues first pushing a third party right now means creating a threat to an existing coalition thats trying to fight facism people are going to respond appropriately to anyone trying to weaken that collective even though theyre not running a presidential candidate in 2024 their only answer for spoiler concerns is well enact election reforms once you get us into power 

second and probably more relevent moving forward is that these third party groups usually come off like either a vanity project or straight up ratfucking by the wealthy because they dont want labor rights or taxes in this case your boy yang is pretty notorious for unseemly pandering and the usual exploitative tech bro libertarianism the wealthy arent exactly known for coming off as in touch with the reality of the average american plus anytime a tech bro starts using buzzwords about diversity of opinions they almost always mean youre not allowed to criticize my altright bros dogshit takes no matter how dangerous they are its 2023 weve all seen where that goes 

third theres nothing of substance here from the website it looks like theyre so focused on what theyre not that they forgot to develop an actual platform they talk about sensible solutions and working together but on what and to what end redistricting collaboration cool that doesnt require a political party
deleted
you really sound like you go around selling your essential oils crystals and belly wraps at your home church prayer meetings and homeschool luncheons
i really miss debates that were genuinely interesting and full of at least sort of insightful exchanges instead of just sound bytes and name calling
family history  genealogy is different to me than someone talking about an archive regarding living people as if personal info of where people live is being given to the church for some reason
its like someone realized they could do a mildly clever wordplay with leftright taken as directions and thats the basis of the party
my friend was a crucial person who helped launch the forward party i think the goals of the people behind the party are noble but until rank choice voting or single transferable vote a third party is useless i got to meet yang through my friend and he truly seems like a nice guy but as much as i like him hes not strong enough of a public speaker to be a great elected leader but is a good behind the scenes leader
cool story fortunately i am not doing any of those things
they literally have a how to of tracking people on their website so they can track down people who have moved without moving their records including people who dont want to be contacted i still get calls from an area i lived in 15 years ago because i stopped going to church as a very young adult"

 so lets put ourselves in the shoes of a woman in that situation if its that late in your pregnancy then almost by definition youve been expecting to carry it to term were talking about women who have perhaps chosen a name women who have purchased a crib families that then get the most devastating medical news of their lifetime something about the health or the life of the mother or viability of the pregnancy that forces them to make an impossible unthinkable choice and the bottom line is as horrible as that choice is that woman that family may seek spiritual guidance they may seek medical guidance but that decision is not going to be made any better medically or morally because the government is dictating how that decision should be made
hey kids in your 20s were going to screw you over on social security and medicare youll pay your whole life and get a significantly lower or even no benefit sucks to be you

gee i wonder why young people dont like republicans
i wish they had listened to what pete buttigieg said about lateterm abortions

wallace its not hypothetical there are 6000 women a year who get abortions in the third trimester

buttigieg thats right representing less than 1 percent of cases so lets put ourselves in the shoes of a woman in that situation if its that late in your pregnancy then almost by definition youve been expecting to carry it to term were talking about women who have perhaps chosen a name women who have purchased a crib families that then get the most devastating medical news of their lifetime something about the health or the life of the mother or viability of the pregnancy that forces them to make an impossible unthinkable choice and the bottom line is as horrible as that choice is that woman that family may seek spiritual guidance they may seek medical guidance but that decision is not going to be made any better medically or morally because the government is dictating how that decision should be made
christie cannot even get applause for saying pro life means being pro life 

he just gave the answer that conservatives have been saying for 50 years and they hated it all the republican base wants at this point is red meat rage bait
what exactly is the point of the republican debates at this point is someone actually planning to run against trump or just auditioning to be his running mate
how crazy is it that chris christie is the most sane person on the republican stage lol
im just tuning in to see what christie does this time lmfao

first debate he called vivek chatgpt

second debate he called trump donald duck for ducking debates

hes gotta have something up his sleeve for this one tonight lmao
a few corrections

1 no state simply allows abortion up to the time of delivery that is bullshit

2 90 of the fentanyl confiscated at the border is being carried by american citizens so go ahead ron shoot em dead

3 inflation has fallen from 9 to 3 and along the same lines gas prices today are virtually the same as they were in 1958a time of huge oil and gas productionadjusted for inflation

this should be tucker carlson joe rogan and elon musk hosting the debate

god ramaswamy is such an insufferable waste of air
i love desantis little headflick whenever he finishes his preplanned comment

nailed it

hes so freaking weird
the united states probably has the strongest economy in the world after a global crisis but biden is a failure
ngland as a progressive demi honestly think that christie could easily win a general election the problem is that he isnt crazy enough to win a republican primary
republicans talking about late term abortions being widespread is just fucking lies

93 of abortions are done before 13 weeks 99 before 20 weeks

those are hard stats from years of data
i need to drink more christie saying things i 100 agree with
that high heels joke really deflated meatball ron  he looks like hes about to cry
christie makes an impassioned plea that being pro life extends to all people for their full lives and not a single person clapped republicans are simply opposed to and incapable of treating others well
vivek gives off like a vampire who accidentally preyed on a meth head energy
nbc nightly news putting dem wins solely on abortion and then saying why this may still be bad for 2024 going out of their way to bring up bidens low polling the nyt sunday poll and including one interview from a person who said biden is doing a bad job on every measure what the fuck is the mainstream medias sick obsession with tearing biden down every chance they get they cant report on even one of the several great things biden has done just this week this is the reason theres so much favorable polling for trump in the first place the media has gone out of their way to paint biden as a failed president when it couldnt be farther from the truth i fucking hate it here
im excited to see how they plan to talk about abortion after getting fucked last night in va and ohio 

theyll totally double down on it and then scream over each other debating who daddy trump loves more gotta woo over the nazis and karens for liberty
christie shutting down islamophobia like it was a bridge
how weird is it that chris christie is the most normal person
christie level headed disagree with him on plenty of stuff but hes more of an actual politician than the rest

nikki better than the other 3 but her warhawk stance on iran is terrifying also calling desantis a liberal on the climate is chilling 

desantis awful in every way

scott a canned tuna

vivek trump 20
the gop presidential candidates are all fucking goobers fraudsters con artists and losers  what a sad group of humans  this is really the best the gop can do  their leader is basically a mob boss criminal too
desantis is holding onto the podium for dear life if he lets go hes going to tilt backwards from those heels
vivek said nbc rigged the 2016 electionthats the one trump won wasnt it
  it cracks me up that ron continues to do thishe has opposed fracking he has opposed drilling haley said of the florida governor he was praised by the sierra club and youre trying to make up for it and act like you werent a liberal when it comes to the environment   
  
were so doomed its liberal to think we should keep the planet healthy
hmm ill have to miss this one i have to return some videotapes
court cases and 91 felonies aside i guess i dont understand why trump wouldnt want to show up to the debates and turn them into the shitshow extravaganza that hes known to do i thought he loved attention 

no stamina sad
new into politics and from this ive learned

out of all these people christie is the most logical but even then thats by comparison

desantis is basically bobby newport from parks and rec

scott doesnt really know hes talking about

haley is pretty double tongued

and vivek is a literal psychopath 

all in all very entertaining shouldve gotten into this way sooner p
what the fuck did ramaswamy just do

x200b

i dont think i have ever seen a candidate go after the moderators like that
ranking the candidates so far

1st christie

2nd haley

100000000th desantis

googleth scott

infinity plus oneth vivek
how fucking stupid do you have to be to go after someones completely uninvolved daughter onstage during a debate scum is right
i guess vivek is going with the meme path to the presidency
christie acknowledged both sides suffering holy shit
everyone too scared to say the retirement age will be 70
as an ohioan get fucked vivek

edit i forgot the obligatory fuck larose
the rnc should have a policy that if you dont attend the debate  you cant be the repulican candidate

its ridiculous that trump just decides not to go yet he is the leading contender for the ticket   the party should not allow it  democrats never would
i had to watch this for my class tomorrow my professor actually used to work for nbc which is pretty cool

this is the easily the worst assignment hes given this semester
the fuck was vivek even saying at the end was he saying trump was actually president or that biden is somehow a puppet for obama and hillary makes no sense and is complete bullshit and yet the qnon crowd went wild people are so dumb
vivek is an unwatchable misogynist
how much money did russia pay vivek to be their personal spokesman
tim scotts debate performance hi ma id have a national 15 week abortion ban iowa farms the truth is my life destroys the radical left if god made you a man you play sports against men its like he wasnt even trying
rnc chair ronna mcdaniel said trump is open to debate he loves to debate  sure jan 

imagine how much trump would totally suck at all of these debates
ramaswamy has hardwired himself directly into the pleasure centers of the republican mind the libertarian nonsense the contrarianism the fast talking bullshittery the conspiracy theories the insufferable douchebaggery dude has the republican voter at least questioning if their racism against indian americans has an exception
friendly reminder that the most recent republican vicepresident didnt even make the third debate because he refused to try to overthrow the government 

that is the current state of the republican party
the republican debates are a good reminder that even republicans not named trump still suck and are generally horrific people
wtf is happening vivek is off the rails holy shit
desantis sweating bullets right now with everyone talking about heels
why is chris christie being so goddamn reasonable where was he at the first two debates
christie spitting some facts there
the way vivec over enunciates is so grating it sounds patronizing hes just so off putting
lmao christie roasting them i might just donate 1 to his campaign to see him up there next month i am enjoying the hell out of this
i wish the moderators would ask define bidenomics
the fact that people are celebrating raising the retiring age is _nuts_
prolife is for the whole life is simply not a concept that republican voters agree with chris sorry
jesus fucking christ vivek biden isnt even president 

what in the actual fuck
its so pathetic that nbcs anchors cant even hide it and are just straight up like yeah theyre all running for second place

and the guy who leads is facing like five dozen fucking felony counts
vivek is actually out of his mind holy shit
all this praise for haley is a bit insane she was against trump before it became a good thing to be for trump and now is against trump again because it suits her

talk about a flip flopper the rest is noise
i dont know anything about most of these people but i watched this for some reason 


ramaswamy sounds like he decided on cocaine that he wanted to run for president and now hes seeing how far you can get without any substance besides cocaine 


haley is trying her best and she has weird fake teeth and she has vague positions and maybe actually thinks she can serve america boy i hope we can do better but we can do worse somehow


tim scott doesnt seem to know why hes here and nobody else does either they cant attack him because he has nothing going on he wasnt offensive enough to appeal to trump fans that might like vivek but can you imagine donny and vivek in the same room


christie is saying the stuff republicans are supposed to support and i wonder if hes confused why they wont support him i imagine its because they actually like insane bullshit and not strong stances measured answers or whether hes a proven leaderhis sanity is boring


desantis needs to stop taking about florida which is the limit of his political vocabulary hes a dud and its weird he doesnt have the insight to recognize what a loser he looks like on that stage
without king circus clown up there you just see how vicious nasty cruel and ignorant the republican mindset is in all its boring glory yes its ultimately used as a ploy to further donor interests and yes the audience was mostly donors but not for the fools who fall for it i cannot believe a single functional adult could fall for any of this yet 60 million people regularly vote for this madness
vivek is a fucking idiot

musk as a mediator
christie for sure trying to appeal to the modern day moderates
haley nodding for christie
interesting
the nuclear submarines are the greatest deterrent 

youre right chris

if only donny hadnt told an australian millionaire where they all are
a tiktok commercial directly after a debate on the threat posed by china 

what the actual fuck is this simulation
the gop field is so bad its making christie and haley look like fucking scientists in comparison
she called him scum
youre just scum yes haley say what were all thinking
cut the gas and diesel tax

nikki haley wants the whole damn countrys roads to look like south carolinas
im 36 been working since ive been 15 paying into social security f them for trying to raise the retirement age
lmao a literal tiktok commercial tiktok trolling the gop 
sounds like nikki wants everyone to mind their own businesses on abortion not bad
can they fuck all the way off with this abortion up to the moment of birth bullshit
speaking as a man

moments before disaster
vivek didnt say a got dam thing about abortion with that word salad
vivek is running on the crowder incel platform
god dammit christie is the sanest person on the stage
since when do democrats support having an abortion up to a day before the child is born nonsense the only way anyone would do this is for a severe medical emergency
vivek earned his russian paycheck tonight
vivek is the most dishonest disappointing of them allabsolutely no ideology no values just follow the focus group recipeif they tell him to eat babies he will eat babies to win the nomination
that was entertaining were dumber for watching that but it was entertaining
im out gonna go snort some fenty
nikki and christie sounded semi normal but have no chance with maga folk
is tim scott just ben carson 20
i feel like im living in an upside down world when im agreeing with christie and nikki the most tim scott was annoying desantis kept telling stories and not answering questions swamy is a fucking nutjob who only plays to the audience and says what they want to hear and flips at every chance he gets and is total bullshit monster if there was another person on stage i already forgot about them
tim scott spent tonight trying to show trump that he can be every bit as evangelical and unremarkable as mike pence but 2 blacker although that number might be high
wait how has it been normalized that p01135809 just doesnt participate in these this whole thing seems super weird and pathetic
christie is fine when hes an underdog and have genuinely liked him in the last year but i also remember the image of his mute obsequecy standing behind trump and wonder if the old chris christie would come back once office was conferred on him again
it really is a diverse set of candidates though we def should applaud the party on that we got

republicans claim biden has shut down energy production in america in fact us oil production is set to reach an alltime high of 128 million barrels a day this year and 131 million in 2024 higher than under trump or any prior president 

httpswwwpoliticocomnews20230828republicansgaspricesoilproduction00111626

us largest is the oil producer in world httpswwwnasdaqcomarticleswhatcountriesarethetopproducersofoil


it woulda been nice if the nbc moderators maybe referenced a little of this when these candidates were going on for half hour claiming the cause of inflation is that we dont drill enough   tim scott saying hed help the current inflation problem by start building the keystone pipeline was fucking stupid and sadly r voters will eat this all up
so give it to me straight was it a shit show
all of the republican candidates just appear low rent and honestly boring 

the more they try to put on a performance the more hollow they appear
i think regardless of what desantis says his chances of the nom died with his battle with disney
vivek starting out with shitting on nbc as if they dont all do meet the press interviews with nbc
vivek attacking the moderators is a choice
vivek is actually insane like bro
vivek is fucking nuts but i think people here are missing that he is absolutely channeling trumps way of talking to people

he understands populism is powerful and that trump proved consistency is overrated   so he says popularish things while simultaneously spewing strong man bullshit that ultimately is batshit insane the moment you peel back any amount of detail

people dont give a shit about the detail so he doesnt actually have to have any consistent views on anything  as a result he gets to fling shit at everything

hes scary
nikki gonna go all will smith on viv
all states that actually vote are going pro choice nikki lol
scott praise sky daddy

christie im sane even though im a republican

vivek daddy trump look at me

nimroda haley merica merica china bad

meatball im tall i swear please listen to my nothingness
thank god the gop is full on idiotic because if they actually nominated christie he might win the general election
vivek liked his heels joke so much he decided to tell it twice hes such a tool
this completely felt like a competition for who is going to be named trumps idiot running mate complete circus
how the republican party doesnt see christie is their best shot to return to a sense of normalcy and their best bet to peel back support from the supposed middle is baffling

yah yah bridge gate and opportunist criticisms

hes a solid politician that knows how to push the worst of the conservative thoughts into the background and is a solid public speaker that can weave in and out of the populist and wonkish spheres

yall really gonna let the opportunity to reset and whitewash the trump era away in record time slip away
 tucker carlson joe rogan and elon musk  
  
jesus christ
how are we at a place where chris christie and fucking nikki haley are the least insane people on stage
ramaswammy is such a piece of shit my god
remember france had literal riots about the retirement age  dont let anyone tell you your retirement is insignificant
lol i stand for a culture of life right after stone cold shot em dead
chris with an actual true definition of prolife

it doesnt end at birth and is not defined by abortion alone in fact the majority comes after birth
my daughter was 5 12mos pregnant when she had emergency surgery for a brain tumor they asked her if it came down to her or the baby what was the preference she picked herself these types of decisions should be between the doctor and the woman
zero talk about the looming government shutdown
absolutely terrible candidates and all dangerous to this country but none of them are a threat to become president even if trump is jailedbarred from running  

luckily for us the maga crowd will never be as in lockstep with a candidate as they are with trump even if one of his kids has watched this whole thing and is stupid enough to try and play the successor they wont cultivate the same united unyielding base donny has  none of these people move the needle for them 

sure down the road trump will pass from everyday conversation and a bunch of terrible people will latch on to a new terrible person but trump is clearly all they have left in their immediate future just need to stomp the turd down the drain one more time until were rid of him
lmao vivek with the dick cheney in 3 inch heels  we have 2 of them on stage tonight

that was hilarious lol
moderators so whats your thoughts on literally any issue besides the border

scott and desantis terrorists from mexico
youre just scum 

bout time someone says it
no way scott is at the next debate
christie is the only one capable of conveying a thought without using full rage
yes please  talk more about cutting social security and medicare  its such a winning issue for republicans almost as much as abortion is
a farm in iowa wut
fuck these commercials whales are awesome
vivek we need to be honest 

10 seconds

vivek complete lie about ohios abortion ban
sexual responsibility

 for men

by vivek
pro life is for the whole life yet no one mentions gun violence
swamy is such a fucking asshole i wouldnt shake his hand or give him eye contact either
closing statements

scott we need a great reawakening and turn from victimhood to victory stop kneeling in protest and kneel in prayer

christie i will open up my heart to every american as president

ramaswamy we are at war with those who dont like our founding principles and a fringe minority he then tells the democrats to end the biden candidacy which he calls a lie and put up their real candidate suggesting michelle obama or gavin newsom

haley a strong america doesnt start wars a strong america prevents wars we cannot do that with politicians from the 20th century we need politicians from the 21st century

desantis im doing this for you i delivered on all my promises for florida and will do the same for the us as president

the fuck the whales commercial is hilarious if biden wasnt saving these whales gas would be 199 a gallon i guess
so wait trump was holding a rally while this was all going on he has a day off from court
the guy who switched from dem to republican in the cnn focus group straight up looks like a serial killer
my take on the five remaining

 desantis sank in the polls because he was not nearly as good in open debate and competing as he was in pushing his own image on top of being a charisma vacuum and it continues to show he has the record of an ideal republican candidate but as 2015 showed that doesnt mean anything compared to how you make conservatives feel

 christie continues to be the most sane man on stage by leagues on various issues and ill miss him when he inevitably pulls out after losing the first few primaries hes the closest thing to the partys conscience screaming in the partys ear before they flick him off

 haley definitely has policies i dont agree with but she was the second most sane and reasonable person on the stage she understands that the us cannot survive acting like the rest of the world is the enemy and that yes the majority of people are at least a little prochoice

 i forgot scott was there multiple times

 ramaswamy is someone to fear in 2028 and beyond because his rhetoric of deliberate ignorance of history and geopolitics while pushing some hybrid monstrosity of fascism and pure capitalism is the exact direction the republican party is heading

while i was glad that nbc finally and directly asked the candidates why to vote for them and not trump the fact that no one not even christie gave a direct answer should be indicative of how pointless this all is they will all absolutely fold and endorse trump the moment he starts winning the primaries

its kind of scary that trumps popularity among his base is at least partially because he isnt even pretending the competition exists it speaks to how much his supporters like the idea of him more than his actual capabilities on stage or as president and will vote for him purely on how he makes them feel and the fearmongering done of the other side

im looking forward to the last debate next month because it means this charade of competition will finally be over 2024 is finally almost here and i just want to know if well put off a hostile takeover of government for another four years or if well be getting it early
wait i thought i was watching snl this is real
overall i found myself agreeing with christie more it really is a shame he isnt polling better haley was okay started off strong but i thought she petered out 

scott was meh

desantis was about mehh too

vivek is an absolute psycho he clearly doesnt belong up there
haley and christie are sane and would make okay presidents even though i disagree with much of their platforms vivek is a conspiracy nut tim scott is a religious fanatic and ron desantis thinks bravado is the same as leading
do i hate myself why am i watching this
vivek weve become a party of losers

rest of us we know
lol swinging at the moderators this is gonna be fun
vivek ramaswamy is insane
vivek definitely edges to putin
why is desantis getting into the superman pose behind a podium lol haley really got him nervous real quick
security gonna have to pull nikki off him
these people refuse to acknowledge global climate change and young voters know it
idk how blasphemous this is to say but haley and christie are by far my favorites on the stage i cant stand vivek at all at all wish he would go away
throughout this debate it seems as if nikki haley and chris christie are talking to the same voters they both promote a muscular foreign policy standing with ukraine and having no time for amateurs at the same time desantis and ramaswamy are talking to their own group of republicans who are less interested in expertise and then theres tim scott citing bible verses and not answering questions like hes a candidate dropped from a pretrump era

x200b

nyt reporters making keen observations
desantis just learned the plural of referendum is referenda and by god hes gonna let everyone know it
haley just gave the republicans an answer on abortion and every man on stage is now mansplaining why a hardline approach to controlling a womans body is preferable
christie actually seemed human tonight
when chris christie is the most rational person on your partys stage youve got huge fucking problems
vivek why is newsom flying to china

why was desantis just on a world tour vivek
lol elon musk and joe rogan is he high
chris christie is right
stealthily and quietly oh my
vivek is completely wrong on military supply chains

they literally halted f35 production when a piece of metal was discovered as coming from china 

httpswwwpoliticocomnews20220907pentagonsuspendsf35deliverieschina00055202
holy shit vivek is absolutely fucking insufferable
vivek seems like the loud guy in an econ 101 class
that baby girl albert einstein
once again dont talk about being prolife if youre not doing something about mass shootings universal health care comprehensive sex ed etc
if you dont feel an abortion is moral dont get one dont tell other people they should go to jail over it
stop me if youve heard this one two italians two indians and a black man walk onto a stage seeking the nomination of the white racist party
christie has always been a sane republican the problem is republicans dont want sane people
why the fuck is vivek still allowed to open his mouth
vivek avoiding shaking hands with haley what a shitbag
its sad that people in some of these other states have votes that matter a lot more than mine in the presidential election
i love watching people fight for 2nd place
the winner is anyone who chose not to watch
audience you stupid fucks shut the fuck up
did vivek make a joke about two people wearing heels on stage referring to desantis
good answer by christie
did vivek just call zelenskyy a nazi
did vivek just call zelenskky a nazi
 if biden had given weapons to ukraine when russia invaded they wouldve already won  
  
biden literally did that
christie is very calming
christiehaley for sane republican ticket 2024
christie observes no one answers the question
wow the nbc live stream on youtube had a 3 minute break and instead of running commercials they ran soothing music and random news slides  thats the nicest thing a corporation has done this year
haley thoughts on tiktok

no im going to respond to the two people that hit me that you didnt let me respond to  

well at least haley finally acknowledges up front that shes not going to answer the question

well call this progress
 mr ramaswamy please weigh in

no lester please dont do that
so are we getting that abortion question
shoot em stone cold dead lol
except anatomy scans are done at 1820 weeks and there is no such thing as a fucking post birth abortion  

if you want to ban post birth abortion or abortion on the delivery day go right ahead  those arent a thing  is the entire republican party this ignorant on anatomy and biology
please do not let nikki fucking haley be thd first woman president
so tired of this stupid ass talking point that women are having abortions 5 minutes before the baby is to be born
if god made you a man you play sports against men

anyone got the citation on that bible verse
vivek the ceo whining about the managerial class lol
jesus vivek is beyond unhinged its insane
imagine a farm 

youre scum

my main takeaways
ramaswamy talking about rons heel situation was so stupid yet funny for me
its very worrying that chris christie is the least bigoted on that stage
vivek really needs to stop attacking haley on foreign policy she will beat him on that subject everytime
vivek is like a typical redditor grabbing at low hanging fruit bringing up haleys daughter
chris christie just gave the answer that republicans have been begging for for 50 years and silence was in that auditorium meanwhile ramaswamy is getting a standing ovation for attacking kristen welker and demanding a debate moderated by elon musk joe rogan and tucker carlson 

the republican party is no longer a serious political movement it stands for nothing but red meat rage bait if the serious people left in the republican party truly wish to see a return to conservatism they need to do the hard thing they need to stop running in primaries controlled by extremist sects and break away start a new party take the temporary loss and tank these fringe candidates by splitting the vote make it impossible for the 10 to win and the other 90 will come back
i already thought this before but seriously haley and christie are the only two people on that stage serious enough and responsible enough to be president of the united states tim scott who in the senate has been a fairly productive and professional member has been an horrible candidate that just produces vague platitudes and has focused too much on a religious right message and his iran comments were outrageously cavalier vivek has unconventional takes that are welcome on some issues censorship for example but overall his foreign policy is a dramatic departure from american hegemony and pax americana and i dont like his transactional isolationist approach to foreign affairs and dealing with authoritarian leaders abroad desantis seems to almost be some amalgamation of their two viewpoints but packages it behind a really insincere scripted facade he doesnt seem to have a real backbone

christie and haley make unapologetic defenses for americas role in the world and our values in ways that dont just come off as a whats in it for us transactional pointofview are the only ones not sidestepping issues like the deficit in favor of xenophobic rhetoric regarding the mexican and i guess canadian borders and talk about trying to find common ground on hot button issues like abortion and drug treatment with liberals in a sane world these two would be the frontrunners and it saddens me that the party has sunk so low in terms of its standards for a nominee since 2012
yo cnn dont put vivek on air anymore this guy is like con reddit speaking on tv
they should have put an empty podium on the stage as a reminder during the entire debate that trump was too afraid to show up
chat gop turned it up to 11 really quick
vivek is genuinely a horrifying candidate
vivek is simply trying to cut an ad nothing he says has substance
ooh vivek with the heels insult
hunter biden should resign from office immediately
a few years ago people were like whoa liz cheney is considered level headed now 

now christie is level headed lmao how fuckin far right are we gonna go
3 inch heels to desantis  is actually elite joke writing
dick cheney in four in heels  think he was talking about haley or desantis
all these republicans dont care about jews stop pretending like they care about antisemitism
this ramyswamy guy is like if you gave beavis bath salts
christy defending muslims thats not going to sit well with this crowd
credit to christie for actually acknowledging discrimination towards muslimsthats how low the bar is for gop
chris and nikki are the adults in the room the other 3 are absolutely vile scum
vivek is a shit tier wannabe dictator
if only president biden started heavily investing in chip production on us soil oh wait he did
im waiting on vik to say to use ufo technology
a social media site pushing antisemitism is bad

looks at twitter
can vivik put that fucking finger down dude loves waiving it around
vivek wants to speed climate change sure kill us sooner
tim scott hi mama 
debate sponsored by tiktok lmao
tim scott talks like his battery pack is low and flickering
she decided to not have an abortion
ramasmarmy fuck the will of the people
viveks anecdote on abortion literally made zero sense
christie is giving alot of reasonable answers tonight
its such a weird day when i agree with chris christie
just once id like a republican debate participant to show some hard facts about this scourge of women terminating their pregnancies right before theyre going to give birth just because they can
vivek is right there is a war between those that support american values and a fringe minority that hates america

the catch is you think youre on the other side
michelle obama still lives rent free in the gops head
ramasmarmy what really happened in roswell joe where is bigfoot is tupac really running the country from cuba
christiehaley came out ahead of the others
that is an insane statement from vivek bro is just spreading conspiracies
aint no way vivek said joe biden is not even our president on live tv
breaking  after ron desantis gave a 2 minute speech about fighting and hitting and winning mickey mouse jumped onto the stage and punched him in the nuts
nikki haley was the obvious standout i still loathe her
desantiss wife just looks happy to be there and have pictures taken of her she strikes me as the exact type of person who would not correct ron calling thai food thigh food not because she doesnt want to upset him but because she thinks it is the correct pronunciation
what the fuck is that whale ez pass commercial
why does christie the largest candidate not simply eat the other four
desantis acting like hes not an elite
vivek open up the bag of insanity
woah unhinged vivek moment
vivek gives off the most loser energy of anyone ive ever seen on a debate stage lmfao
started the debate late to this goofball saying this should be moderated by joe rogan tucker carlson and elon musk
vivek showing exactly why theyre a bunch of losers jfc
ramaswamy somehow manages to upgrade his gigacringe rating every debate despite all odds a debate moderated by tucker and joe rogan jesus fucking christ this is something youd read on freaking political compass memes or some shit i swear
vivek has pivoted to full conspiracy fuck you mode trumps running mate
this is the most unhinged debate yet and its not even 15 minutes in
finish them by carpet bombing innocent palestinians bite me nikki
nikki haley is the only one up there who had any understanding of foreign policy even when i dont agree with her at least she understands what is going on and the complexity and nuance
im convinced that everybody on this stage would suck bibis asshole live on tv and the audience would give a 2 minute standing ovation
lmao vivek is insane but hes got jokes
vivek messed up the delivery on what coulda been a funny reference to desantisshoeliftgate
how is it that chris christie is the most sensible person on stage what is happening
heels as ammunition

nikki haley is bayonetta confirmed
its sad watching them talk about antisemitism after they spent all of 2020 being antisemitists
tim scotts casual authoritarianism
rogan on his next podcast you know that vivek guy the media was trying to say he was acting insane in that debate but i dont knowim not saying hes the guy im just saying he made a lot of good points
pro tip student and work visas include the same 1st amendment rights and limits as any citizen
did vivek just call zelenskyy a nazi
nikki haley is right  phrase i never expected to say
chris christie being remarkably restrained  im hoping he goes full new jersey on vivek
christie is the only person on that stage thats even close to being presidential
how is it that the guy who closed the george washington bridge during rush hour just to spite his political opponent is also the guy whos the most levelheaded on this stage
fight on 3 continents at the same time jesus what thats nuts

maybe we should make sure our alliances are strong so that europe can mostly handle itself and so south korea japan taiwan australia and new zealand have our backs in the pacific
youre just scum  love the cat fight
we might witness an actual murder on stage tonight vivek should be scared for his life
haley about to pull a will smith
desantis has a nice nimby attitude on drilling  fraking will drill everywhere but not near my home
during the start of the ukraine war we asked oil companies to drill more and they said no because that would be irresponsible to their shareholders to cut profits

the government doesnt set oil prices business does
holy shit what the fuck is going on with chris being level headed saying social programs are a good thing
these assholes be like hey im gonna retire now but you can work til you die  vote for me
chris safety nets are good so people dont end up in poverty

soo chris how about a safety net surrounding health care where everyone would have a benefit over their life
sell out the young to get votes now fuck that
theres another way to fix the debt

the us has one of the worlds lowest tax burdens especially for the rich have they considered matching europe or 1950s america
ah yes grow the economy by laying off 34 of people from the largest employer
to the 20 year olds out there screw you
lmfao the embarrassing attempt at iowa pandering by scott
wtf is this ad fuck them whales lmao
desantis actually acknowledging you cant raise the retirement age when life expectancy is decreasing is surprisingly aware for this group
hmm what to do about social security

lets see someone making 90m a year pays as much into ss as someone making 160k a year

surely the answer is to slash benefits
as someone who has lost a loved one to the opioid crisis i want to shake chris christies hand a real fucking answer that isnt just a continuation of the failed war on drugs that targets sick people as criminals
its funny that people dont realize that if you fully shut the border then our whole agricultural sector goes to absolute shit who do you think works on the farms that provide food to stores
nikki saying she doesnt judge people for being prochoice

that wont go over well
nikki look its impossible by the legislative process to federally ban abortion lol
im amazed how many of these people seem to believe that abortions happen regularly on the day of birth i can see the head its going straight into the dumpster
vivek has no business in politics dude is a freaking wang
yes im sure men will vote for sexual responsibility for men lmfao
ah yes being financially tied to a man definitely is the same as having access to healthcare these people are insane
vivek going after nikkis daughter for low political punch should tell you that hes going to fuck over all of our allies for whatever perceived minor gain
vivek all nightnot many people know about this

proceeds to tell complete fucking lies
tim scott definitely involved with men
chris christie is too moderate to be in a republican debate
um biden is the president of the united states vivek is crazy as fuck why are they applauding him
two questions 

1 what exactly is the managerial class 
2  what is with the republican super online obsession with michelle obama running for office
nikki haley is the only one on that stage who would beat biden imo thankfully trump will never give her a chance
vivek is unhinged trump has some competition
i opened fox news website to see what they think of the debate but the debate doesnt exist on fox news

why are the right wing so bizarre and strange
trump is the problem he attempted a coup stole top secret documents and engaged in massive business fraud for decades he has also called for the termination of the us constitution httpswwwcnncom20221203politicstrumpconstitutiontruthsocialindexhtml
watching this back now and tim scotts intro is nauseating christofacism can kindly fuck off
straight up desantis looks like a chuck e cheese animatron
youre just scum haleys beyond done with this fuck
nikki haley is like the elizabeth warren of the republican party 

shes evidently the smartest person on the stage   and shes doomed by that
its a shame that christie doesnt have more support
vivek is trumps legacy trump proved that its the biggest pantsshitter who gets the attention and therefore the support of the deplorable 50 of the country were not putting this back in the bottle its just going to be more and more insane pantsshitters
these folks should be embarrassed the top person isnt even willing to show up he is making these douches look like d bags
prediction 



vivek will say some outrageous obnoxious nonsense to get back in the headlines and fail so miserably tonight he will offend conservatives to the point where fox oann and newsmax wont hire him as a permanent election consultant  

hell get a few spots as a guest commentator in 2024 but vivek will not parlay this into a paid gig
christian values lmao
tim scott is dave chappell in that skit where hes in the kkk and doesnt know hes black
lmao three inch heels 
vivek just comes off as a low level troll
someone tell tim scott its ok to talk faster than 025 speed
tim scott like really sucks at this
nikki says that she told israel to finish them and then in the same monologue says that the last thing israel needs is for someone to tell them what to do 

good grief take your own advice woman
christie is the only one sounding semi reasonable
i hate saying this but christie gave the best answer
he does sound like chatgpt they werent lying
welp vivek is going for the moms for liberty vote
if scott really wanted to tie federal funds to speech on college campuses as a senator he could draft and submit a bill tonight to address that point 

so why hasnt he
did vivek really just call zelenskyy himself a nazi
christie should win
christie out here sounding reasonable the bastard
desantis visibly twitching when his name is mentioned hes so weird
ron defascist is trying to pose like homelander from the boys so hard
ron is sweating profusely
vivek  buffoon

desantis  douche

christie and haley are by far the best scott isnt doing badly but i give him third place
ill give christie credit for making a solid one liner from time to time id share 12 whoppers with him
thank god vivek ramaswamy will never be president
chris christie is looking good tonight
bout to see a will smith moment leave my daughter out of your voice
vivek seems to accept hes got no chance so hes decided to just flip the table over and start shitstirring instead
desantis looks so fucking goofy in the middle of this
someone make fun of viveks hairline please i know he will have a fullon meltdown
ron needs to keep his fucking head still his mannerisms are so unlikable
were still talking about the keystone xl pipeline in the year of our lord 2023 lmao
why does tim scott and every other republican always compare gas prices to what they were 23 years ago

was there some national event that happened 202021 that would make gas prices an outlier
tim scott trying to court the seven pence voters by dropping random bible verses
yes having a ceo in the white house worked so well last time
drink every time desantis finds a spot to wedge in an obviously rehearsed offthecuff quip or turn of phrase im wasted
are these people running for president of israel they bring every topic back to israel
maybe its just me but all of the candidates have a sort of hard icy edge to them

theres no ronald reagan warmth and jocularity here    its all very sharp and angry  maybe a slight exception for christie who is the least grating  

it makes for unpleasant watching
fuck raising the retirement age just tax all income for social security instead of only the first 125k
wow christie making great points here
in a rational world with a normal opposition party christie is winning this debate by a lot 

unfortunately this is not a rational world
so is vivek a moscow plant to degrade america or just that dumb
yes ron desantis im sure a father who just lost his son took the time away from mourning to repeat one of your campaign speeches back at you
desantis threatening extrajudicial killings
catch and release

fish fear her
vivek i am against fentanyl laced hamburgers

wait for applause
desantis vibrating butt plug just reminded him to smile and it was creepy as fuck
someone give this man a ricola
i honestly dont hate the mind ya business position on abortion lol
vivek so we can tell women

yeah thats the exact attitude theyre fighting against chief
vivek showing that hes got the smoothest brain of them all
who performed the best christie 

who won trump

this debate wasnt the breakout moment any of these people had hoped for tim scott and ramaswamy need to drop from the race tomorrow most of these people have little chance of winning but they have no chance
he should be cut off this is irresponsible for nbc this man is calling for civil war
that wasnt a microdose vivek
anyone have michelle obama illuminati on their bingo card
haley is definitely too hawkish for my liking but her assessment of geopolitical threats is spot on
whoever had michelle obama on their bingo card just won
haley won christie came in second and the other 3 are fucking clowns
well we did it we sat through that whole 2 hour pointless shit fest
that was a very boring vice presidential debate
so basically the cheeto is gonna win the nomination
i thought cnn was fake news now all of a sudden they want to go on it and have the debate on nbc ah ok lol
go away vivek nobody gives a shit about your failed ted talkcampaign
trump is barreling towards gross paranoid psychosis as the walls close in psychiatrist

httpswwwrawstorycomtrumpmentalstate2666172919
yea   wheres donald

yo repubs  youre about to vote for a man whos too chicken to show up

thats showin them huh
vivek has little dick energy
forgot this was coming on tonight not sure i should watch they kind of just seem to talk about the same crap
time for the shitshow
geez vivek is ridiculous
lets not do this  is that about the cheering or about the debate as a whole
ramaswamy swinging hard for vp
can we please stop with the live audience it literally adds nothing
the truth of my life destroys the radical left as an iowan ive heard this shitty line from his commercials for the past six months
tim scott thinks its 2000
whoever that was just advocated that american government needs religion is a fucking psycho
its crazy how i keep hearing we need to blindly support israel with anything they want yet these same people want to literally cut support to ukraine because we should spend more inside the country impossible to keep a consistent position
he wasnt talking about you nimrata
vivek is crazy as shit
buzzword vomit salad
did tim scott take too many benedryls
how did scott get this far
i once again beg snl to do a debate sketch where every time they cut to desantis he is slightly taller until his head is out of frame like the sheriffs hat in scary movie 3httpsyoutubebkjsq_m2rqcfeatureshared
somehow chris christie is the least awful on the stage and thats not saying much at all these people are monsters
accountability for ukraine but carte blanche for israel makes sense
vivek is so intensely annoying jfc
vivek always speak like he just did a line of coke
so according to vivek lets go ahead and give the predominantly spanish speaking states back to mexico
vivek literally is a russian plant
ramdatschwami is a giant piece of shit
it could not be more obvious that vivek is just a trump attack dog sent to fuck with the frontrunner here  absolutely nuts
vivek has prepared some pretty good attacks on desantis and desantis didnt even have a comeback you know what ill give that to him hes good at attacking people

if only somebody attacked trump
what a stupid question none of these people should have a plan for number of ships and when until they talk to the military and diplomatic personnel
ramaswamy has such an annoying nerdy communication style he makes haley seem cool lol
bro cannot stay on topic
keep my daughters name out your fucking mouth
the gop are not serious people
vivek being on this stage is pathetic what an abomination
were they planning on talking about america tonight
bro is this the foreign policy debate move the fuck on and talk about america jesus its already been an hour
i love that tim scott is still in the debate it gives me an opportunity to get up and get a snack each time he starts to ramble on
ron is so awkward 
i stood on the simon bolivar bridge watching venezuelans teem into columbia for a hot meal fleeing socialism for freedomand anyways biden gave them all tps which means only more of them are going to come here seeking said freedom which is bad or good i cant recall
rons conscious shift in body language is always hilarious
ive never understood why republicans hate the environment so much its so bizarre and incredibly depressing
keystone is not going to bring gas prices down lol
ask them how much a gallon of milk is
desantis looks like an alien pretending to be a human
yes thats what most people do  fill up their cart add up the cost and then remove items until you get down to your budget  sure ron
how is christie the only sane person on stage
love how theyre supposedly against the richer getting richer but address nothing about regulating corporations
raising the retirement age on younger people is a crazy play to try and get the young vote lets see how this plays out
and yet again everyone is going to ignore that all rich people dont have to pay ss taxes anymore once they go past about 160k in income 

no instead we must hurt everyone else
why is ramaswamy is so aggressive
tim scott cant help but bring up his momma at least once every five minutes
i said im sorrryy mama
hey yall ready to work until 70 and then enjoy it for 5 years before dropping dead from the summers we gonna enjoy in 40 years
whoops  desantis admitting the us is not number 1 and that life expectancy in the richest nation on earth is declining yet 60 million people lap up the bullshit this party throws in their face endlessly
what was that whale gas ad
republicans hate whales now
ronald talking about congress robbing social security something he voted on and life expectancy declining because of a massive mismanagement to covid19 that he participated in is really something else
i take a nap between every word tim scott speaks
omg defascist is gonna build the wall and shoot them stonecold dead just wow
damn i thought he was gonna say that baby turned out to be his wife so close
i think this is as realistic and informed as a prolifer gets

not to mention leaving it in the hands of the people seems to be gradually legalizing it
wow tim scott you really do want to lose
republican argument that abortion should be a state issue and not a federal issue is absolutely fucking disgusting

should rape be a state issue what about child porn what about terrorism

there are some human rights issues that are innate to all humans period

leaving it to states just hurts the poor vulnerable abused women who cant easily go to another state and get an abortion women who have the means will just go to another state 

fuck every one who wants the government to control womens right to choose
how about we go back and let women choose what they want to do 

it was fine for over 50 years and 70 of americans agree
do republicans really think that a women wakes up one day being 35 weeks pregnant and say nah time to get an abortion
what is being done about the white walkers coming down from the north
seriously will a woman who has carried a baby for 9 months suddenly decide to abort it

fucking idiots
ramaswamy can fuck right off with scott twice for referencing clarence thomas
vivek what a dumb comparison
i wouldnt trust vivek for school board
all these people talking about 9 month abortions it doesnt even make sense its not like the doctorshospital are going to kill the baby they pull out they would deliver it and it would be put up for adoption
if i was a republican i would probably vote for christie
and here we go with evangelical nonsense religion has no place in politics
wow vivek just basically said that biden is not the president
did ron just close with the same thing he opened with like verbatim
vivek is why i sometimes question the wisdom of the 1st amendment
desantis is pureed celery
deleted
hes just such a fundamentally decent person
no woman is flippantly making that decision and it should be hers alone the party that says smaller government has been interfering in womens lives for too long
that dude gets it more than any person politician or otherwise ive ever heard off
from 2020 and its still the best answer on this topic ive ever heard from a politician
this always comes to mind when this issue rears up its the perfect answer
the trouble is that understanding that position requires them to use empathy which is frankly in short supply on the r side outside of their very immediate tribe  if this happens inside a relationship of theirs friend spouse loved one they can understand it but not really until
exactly and thats if you can get a doctor to do it  many wont unless its the most tragic situation
why would they clap they arent pro life in any way or age they are pro birth and pro control but not pro birth control because reasons
yes sadly you hit the nail on the head
its just a lying competition where there is no winner because theyre all losers
is someone actually planning to run against trump or just auditioning to be his running mate

usually it seems to be this they offer their endorsements combined with backing out of the race for some backroom dealing on being appointed to a position in the cabinet to help further their own careers but im not sure with this bunch most aside from ramaswamy  appear to be openly hostile to trump at minimum calling out his record and at worst calling him out directly with the way trump holds a grudge i cant imagine hell be thrilled to receive their endorsements or even plan to appoint them to cabinet positions
chris christie was always sane his problem was that hes a piece of shit
i hope he gets another ufo question
i laughed my ass off at how out of left field that was
lol he just looks so weird and uncomfortable all the time makes me laugh a lot and facepalm
but its easier to scare people and complain
he definitely could  he and nikki i think could be problematic for biden
and late term abortions are tragic horrible choices that really we dont need legislative road blocks for
almost like if you carry a baby to near term you wanted that baby and you were forced into the position of making a heart wrenching but necessary choice to prevent the suffering of a baby or to keep yourself alive
the media created trump they are going to milk him as a viable candidate as long as they can
easy answer 

biden is boring 

hes boring predictable quiet and he does his boring job before he eats his boring dinner and goes to bed with his boring wife hes so vanilla that when he eats ice cream he has to pick chocolate or hed be arrested for cannibalism

trump is a reality show gone off the fucking rails hes destructive he says bonkers shit with absolutely no context or relevance to the current situation even the people who despise him watch anything with him in it to try and figure out what hes going to do next he yells at his staff and fucks pornstars behind his wifes back thats sheer entertainment value

as far as media is concerned boring loses money and batshit insane makes money

theyd rather get rich now and then wait out the fascist uprising than even think about dropping any percentage points off their stock value for the next fiscal year

therefore they shit on biden so they can turn a bigger profit

for the record i vastly prefer government to be boring i like it when things on the hill are nice and dull
trump is good for the media hes loud hes controversial hes ratings hes viewers hes money

biden isnt

simple
so dems had a big win yesterday did that match their polling it seems like everyone was surprised so it sounds like the results did not match the polling if thats the case why would anyone trust the polling for the presidential race next year
i expect them to have a softer message on abortion and expect to hear the 15 week narrative tossed around
it really helps to sink in just how far right this country has been flung in just 10 years
because hes not a religious psycho
i dont like christie for several reasons but hes the best of the bunch and its not close unfortunately for him the gop is trumps party and they hate christie
anyone with morals wouldnt get support in the current party but also anyone with morals wouldnt be a republican most likely either
bro they still believe it regardless that trump won its just quoting the fascist playbook somehow the media is both all powerful with the ability to control the government and elections and too weak to push their chosen candidate at the same time
be kind rewind
because someone might land a decent hit on him and make him look like the gigantic clown he is
welcome to tonights vice president audition
hes far too reasonable to be nominated
the problem is there will be no retirement age isnt a number
democrats have standards
my guess is that was pulled from deep down in the rconservative conspiracy theory cesspool that vivek knows will get the base frothed up  thats what makes him so dangerous he really seems like hes weaponizing the lunatics through data science instead of just riding the wave of crazies by crowdsourcing his applause lines like trump did  trump is a reality tv star that understands what reality tv fans want  vivek is different he is a performance artist that is smart enough to target his act where it will be the most effective
brother is a sociopath xd
tech bro speak
 five dozen fucking felony counts

92  closer to 8 dozen
floridian here believe you me many of us are tired of hearing desantis and despise the way he talks about our state
the rnc is weak they do whatever trump says
the bestworst part of this is i have no idea who is who
yes if one of them gets elected were going to war with iran china mexico somehow and every blue city in america
honestly i was scared or i would be if i didnt know they are lying and performing who knows what they really think
an ad saying kill the whales so that we can drill more oil is just plain weird and oddly it probably is something the majority of republicans would support
his daughtergirlfriend testified today
and its funny how all of them are basically wasting their time because the person who will be the nominee anyway doesnt even have to show up and is currently on trial for federal crimes what a fucking bizarroworld
my thoughts exactly chris and nikki are just normal old corpomilitary industrial complex republicans that type doesnt really seem as scary as they once did now that we have seen true crazy fuck tim scott though and his national religion sounds like he is itching for gilead
nah theyd both be shit but the bar is so low now that wed have to give them credit for being shit but within constitutional parameters 

the rest of them will just rip up the constitution and dance on it as they impose their authoritarian regimes
i have a mom too hes so relatable
she seems to be the only one to realize abortion is a losing issue for republicans
 hes so vanilla that when he eats ice cream he has to pick chocolate or hed be arrested for cannibalism

rofl
for which they have no intention of ever keeping to no matter what they say
to rightwingers morals are

1 lgbt is the greatest immorally

2 unwed sex is the next greatest immorality even better if they had sex young that means they learned how bad it was and will prevent you from its horror

3liberals are immoral nonchristians are immoral

4taxation is theft and immoral

5not having money is immoral and a personal flaw

x200b

they are the moral ones we are lusty immoral takers
chris christie has been waiting to fuck up trump for a while and hes smart enough to do it i dont like the guy but its nice to see he isnt a total spineless loser like the rest of them are
who knows what they really think

its beginning to look a lot like griftmas
make no mistake its personal trump backstabbed christie over the vp appointment before kicking him off the transition team gave him covid then called him up in the hospital when christie legitimately thought he was dying just to ask if christie was going to publicly say he got covid from trump christie absolutely despises the man"
im jeffrey goldberg the editor in chief of the atlantic i profiled general mark milley detailing how he protected the constitution from donald trump ask me anything,"hi reddit i interviewed the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and those closest to him for more than two years until general mark milley no chairman of the joint chiefs had confronted the possibility that the president might provoke a coup

milley had several goals in the chaotic final days of the trump administration keep the us out of reckless unnecessary wars overseas maintain the militarys integrity and his own and prevent the administration from using the military against the american people along the way he deflected trumps exhortations to have the us military ignore and even on occasion commit war crimes

for our november cover issue i tell the story of the man who may have done more than any other american to defend the constitutional order in the unprecedented time before and after the 2020 election you can read my story herehttpswwwtheatlanticcommagazinearchive202311generalmarkmilleytrumpcoup675375 watch an interview with msnbc herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_vi8wt3omoq and read my previous reporting herehttpswwwtheatlanticcomauthorjeffreygoldberg

proof bitly3qtotyihttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1o1dp2kabrs4w70dogstomc682oagk3hviewuspsharing  
edit i appreciate all of the insightful questions today i enjoyed going indepth on my reporting of general mark milley and providing additional analysis for more coverage from the atlantic please follow us on social media theatlantic","it is my understanding that donald trump and his associates have begun outlining proposals for utilizing the federal government to target some of his highestprofile critics should he secure a second term next year per reports trump has privately told advisors and close allies this year that hed like to see the department of justice probe individuals who railed against his first administration one of the names that was brought up by trump includes gen mark milley

trump has also floated the prosecutions of individuals at the fbi and the department of justice

beyond milley who were some other important individuals in safeguarding america against trump and who might he target if reelected

also per reports trumps associates are also mapping out ways to use the insurrection act at the start of a potential second term which would give him the ability to use military forces to quell civil unrest

who if anyone would take on the brave role milley played last time around and what impact might sen tommy tubervilles actions in preventing military appointments be in how that plays out
jeffrey 

first of all my god what an outstanding piece on general milley i dont think ive read a better piece all year so kudos to you

the best professor i ever had steve roberts cokies husband said that the news media is biased against whoevers in power and in favor of a good story ive been flabbergasted frankly at the coverage of the biden presidency and how legacy media in particular have bent over backwards to frame things poorly for this president particularly given the continued strength of the economy my perception is that too many reporters and editors are caught up in the concept of narrative and tailoring coverage based on what they believe the prevailing narrative is do you think we have a crisis in our news media
as we saw over and over again during the previous administration so many of americas safeguards against leaders with ill intent are built not on law but on gentlemens agreements personal integrity and as in the case of the us military organizational culture 

any thoughts from milley yourself or others on how we inculcate those values more widely and enduringly
do you have a sense of what if any political retribution there would be against individuals like mark milley under a second trump administration with rumors about bad actors like jeffrey clark making plans for this im wondering what shape it could take
 along the way he deflected trumps exhortations to have the us military ignore and even on occasion commit war crimes

what war crimes did trump ask miley or the us military to commit
do you think milley has retirement plans that include politics
do you have any insight about what mark milley think about gen mike flynns involvement in an attempted insurrection and his continuing involvement with engaging militias how does he still receive a pension 

dealing with trump what was milleys final straw moment how does he deal with the backlash brought own by his vilification by trump
what do you think would have happened had someone with less integrity than milley had been in his role which is another way of asking how concerned we should be about a similar set of circumstances occurring in the future without a jcs chairman committed to milleys set of goals

x200b

thanks for taking the time for this ama
in your opinion what is the most grievous thing that trump has done
have you seen any information on how the military has protected the country from people like kushner who would not qualify for security clearances had it not been for trump in the presidents seat or michael flynn who plead guilty to having contact with russia and later got a pardon from trump how did the military operate knowing people in the trump white house administration were security threats how did the military not believe a coup attempt was possible knowing these threats existed for years
why does the media validate trump by covering his redundant ramblings  why does media continue to try to cover trump like he or his supporters are remotely normal does your interview with milley make you rethink how you will handle his many trials and the 2024 election democracy is in the breach according to milley
what role did gen milley play in communicating with other countries in the last weeks of the trump administration
trump claims russia would not have invaded ukraine and hamas would not have attacked israel if he were president instead of biden what does miley think of this claim
how has your time in the idf informed your coverage of the ongoing israelgaza war if at all and what do you make of criticisms that it biases you
how has your background affected the objectivity of the atlantics coverage of the israelpalestine conflict in gaza
were you able to glean any insight into trumps support system outside the government and their influence on say milleys area the military 

how great or little was the external influence on milley and was he forced to any extreme or emergency measures to curtail undue outside influences
if trump had a friendly general in charge would he try to execute a coup
how do you think the role of social media in elections has evolved from 2020 and do you think there has been any meaningful change regarding oversight of false information on such platforms
how do you respond to allegations that this piece is simply a pr effort from milley to attempt to save his reputation after his association with trump
big fan and subscriber to the atlantic here 

how can we personally help to revive and expand the spirit of civicmindedness that american democracy depends on but is being eroded by populist far right and far left politics
hello jeffrey goldberg

would you please edit the last sentences here here and here to include links to your work to be read

next question if donald trump is elected in 2024 what is your prognostic outlook

thank you
hey jeff thanks for your work we need people to highlight those who are helping hold our democracy together
every time i see your name i think of how atrios over at eschaton used to use an image of ralph wiggum eating paste whenever he linked to something that jeff goldstein had written often with the caption the stupid it burnshttpswwweschatonblogcom200702owwwwwwwwwwwwhtmldisqus_thread i know thats the two of you are different people with vastly different viewpoints and i apologize for making that association but thats just the way my brain works 

as for my question i was just wonderingumdo you likestuff

why did gen milley decided to become a shadow president an interpreter of the presidents orders rather than simply resign and tell the public how insane trump was

why did he enable trump and allow him to limp along further destroying the view of the us on the world stage when he could have exposed it and helped to end it
excellent article 

_______________________

in your writing i hope you will help people learn to focus on the principles and values laid out in the preamblehttpswwwuscourtsgovaboutfederalcourtseducationalresourcesabouteducationaloutreachactivityresourcesustext22we20the20people20of20thefor20the20united20states20of    it may not be consider as law but the supreme court has said it is the purpose reason cause of the article of the constitution to facilitate a government that can protect promote and advance the principles and values denoted by and within the preamble

write more on this very important point and fact    also write to help people understand that when politicians create and craft legislation it should be in cohesive respect regard and duty and purpose to those principles and values within the preamble

people need to know the preamble is not just a collection of words they have deep meaning to what is americas representative democracy and americas establishment of a republic form of representative government    its first words are we the people

remind the public how the preamble is ignored within congress and never addressed and never referred to when legislation is being debated   remind them that it is the guiding light to honoring the articles within the constitutions of their responsibilities

additional

remind and make people aware that republicanism of today does not aspire to respect the preamble to the united states constitution

the republicans have devoted themselves to the preamble from the confederate constitution

if you read both preambles you will notice the differences and you will see why republican promote each state acting in its sovereign and independent character  it does not say in order to form a more perfect union   and you will see and notice it left out promote the general welfare and it left out provide for the common defense  and it invoked religion by its statement of invoking the favor and guidance of almighty god    when we have freedom of religion and not all religions use the word god  thus so the confederate constitution is by inference promoting judeochristian language which violate the freedom of religion as if judeo christianity is the national religion

as a writer you can do much good to invest time and develop a story that details these distinctions which will show and demonstrate the motivation of republicanism to invoke confederacy ideology within how our nation is governed

once you write on it other writers will pick up on the understanding and expound more and expose the covert and overt agenda that republican has engaged that has created and caused and promoted dissension and misdirection in the principles and values of our united states of americas preamble they sought to bastardize the articles of the constitution to try and contort them to accommodate and make way for confederacy ideology to usurp the united states preamble and its constitutional articles and its amendments

educate people the truth is far more impactful in the betterment of peoples lives and the affairs and stability of this nation

general mark milley understands that very well    its why he stood guard to protect this nation as his sworn duty to the nation and the constitution

hopefully you dont ignore this

x200b

if you dont want to write on it pass it on to someone who will expound and do so with detail to simplify and make it understandable even unto a 4th or 5th grader given students and uninformed adults information they desperately need in learning and within understanding of the civics of americas republic form of representative governance within and through our representative democracy
hi jeffrey thanks for doing this ama

your career has been marked by a series of decisions that range from questionable  like volunteering for the idfhttpswwwtheatlanticcomnationalarchive201201moreonjewishmccarthyismandneonazismearinglastpostihope252125 to serve as an mp in the ketziot prison camp during the first intifada   to in my opinion unforgivable like writing this piecehttpswwwnewyorkercommagazine20020325thegreatterror that falsely claimed that sadaam hussein had wmds and ties to alqaeda

in most industries demonstrating this level of bias and being so egregiously wrong would result in censure andor diminished career prospects but you have risen quite high among the american political commentariat which leads me to my actual question

given your background and clear ideological loyalties why should we trust that this article is anything but a hagiography of a conservative fellowtraveler who would almost certainly have no problem with trumps fascist overreach if he were less uncouth and did a better job of following procedure

thanks
if you could replace your voice with a random male voice would you
ive found _the atlantic_ has most consistently had compelling often insightful articles with timely appeal and not just about politics but broader issues so im curious to ask since youre the editor in chief what makes you say we need to publish this when an author or writer pitches an article what do you see as being the elemental composition of a story that should be published in _the atlantic_
if you read this gen milley i for one would like to thank you for your guardianship of the constitution and by extension america it cant be stated enough how much most of us appreciate your integrity thank you sir
no questions just wanted to say how much i love the atlantic and the work you guys do over there dont go away
is it detrimental for individuals who have no military service to be elected president of the united states   as seen with trump he was a clueless idiot who did not listen to or heed the advice of his military leaders
yea  who is going to protect us and the constitution if trump wins again
thank you

apparently there were several other key individuals in the executive office that also protected the usa in similar ways one even involved diverting glorious leaders attention away from wholesale violence using candy
do you believe that from president donald trump benefits from unfairdifferent treatment in court compared to ordinary citizens do you happen to have examples for or against
do you think tommy tuberville is holding up military promotions in an attempt to save those assignments for trump loyalists following the 2024 presidential election
new to the country a grad student here
what phase of election are we currently in and what the perks for immigrants ifffffff trump wins same doubt if joe biden wins who do you think is going to win and by when would the final count be done
did your interview with general mark milley reshape your view of january 6th 

it was horrific on its own but its chilling to read about the adult in the room needing to stay on guard against this narcissist
do you get a sense that milley is a good representation of a highranking formeractive military or an outlier do you feel other generals in his position would have been as upstanding for the constitution and military integrity or was us democracy just very lucky to have him in the white house
youve stressed in responses here how much the military wants to keep politics at arms length and i agree thats a great thing

however given the disaster that was the last administration do you believe there are any discussions among senior officers in the armed forces being had about how best to preparesafeguard protocolsprocedures for a possible second trump administration especially with trump having made it known he intends to seek retribution
hi andy i know im late and youll probably never see this but i just wanted to say thank you for serving as editor in chief over the absolute bestinclass magazine in the modern era i have fallen in love with the atlantic over and over again after stumbling upon hundreds of wellwritten fascinating and utterly unique articles in recent years and im sure your vision has much to do with that fact
what an amazing piece  thank you
what was trumps objective in attacking iran was it just to destroy the nuclear facilities or a full on regime change invasion
no questions just want to thank you for your illuminating story
after your reporting the washington post characterized general milly as controversial do you think that was unwarranted and what was up with that
i dont want anyone to have the impression that it was only mark milley who stood against the anticonstitutionalists and insurrectionists there were plenty of others including people inside the administration the issue is what happens the next time around the trump team understands now that in order to carry out its plans it needs to weed out from important positions anyone with an independent mind or anyone who expresses loyalty to the constitution over loyalty to the president   
its too early to say what tommy tubervilles actions will mean for 2025 but generally its not a good thing when the orderly promotion process is tampered with among other things this sort of politicization of the military only serves to drive the best people away one could argue that the trump team is interested in finding more malleable people to fill these important posts but its too early to know how tubervilles actions will affect the long term promotions picture
yes if theres one thing we learned between 2016 and 2021 its that laws matter but norms matter more what we saw in the runup to the election in 2016 is a candidate who didnt respect or wasnt even familiar with the norms that have governed the behavior of elected officials and those who seek higher office of all the many surprising events associated with the rise of donald trump the most shocking to me was this donald trump mocked the wartime heroics of senator john mccain and then actually rose in standing in the republican party in some ways we had as a society no protection against this sort of phenomenon because we never imagined it could happen and by the way im not trying to avoid your question actually i am i dont know how to inculcate democratic behaviors and norms into a society that doesnt seem to value them as much as i thought i will say this there are only two ways for this country to learn the value of being a rulesbased representative democracy the easy way and the hard way the easy way is to choose leaders who respect the norms and laws of a democratic society and who can act with restraint in office as for the hard way i think youre all familiar with that option
donald trump and his associates have made it abundantly clear that they will target their enemies for legal retribution weve already seen hints of this when he was president at one point trump angered by criticism directed at him by two retired fourstars adm william mcraven and gen stanley mcchrystal threatened to call them back to active duty which is something that can be done with certain seniorranking officers in order to courtmartial them trump has already accused gen milley of various terrible things he clearly has it out for him
i sincerely doubt that he would go into politics but never say never these generals are trained over decades to hold politics at armslength at least and its in principle a bad idea  as milley well knows  to turn to the military for civilian leadership a healthy democracy shouldnt need generals to lead us out of trouble great military leaders play an obviously indispensable role in defending the country and defending the ideas that animate the american experiment but in a perfect world they wouldnt go into politics at all such moves muddy the waters and blur the bright line between military leaders and the civilians they work for
its no fun to be attacked the way milley has been attacked of course but the backlash just comes with the job what is unusual about this is that the military has rarely if ever been politicized this way 

the final straw moment for milley came during the lafayette square protests after the george floyd murder donald trump led milley and the secretary of defense mark esper among others into lafayette square as a show of force milley in his combat fatigues wasnt quite sure what was happening and peeled off when he realized but it was too late and he was excoriated for participating in what was understood to be a political act he and esper both felt that trump had suckered them into attending and then a week later when milley apologized for his actions trump became angry at him telling him that apologizing was a sign of weakness their relationship was fully ruptured after that as for flynn milley doesnt talk about him but i imagine he thinks about flynn what nearly all generals think about flynn if you catch my drift
milley told me he believes that any fourstar general officer would have done what he did in similar circumstances he has more confidence in his fellow generals than i do its not that i have any reason to believe that they are corrupt or antidemocratic in some way but i do think that not all of them would have the strength and oppositional nature necessary to stand up to trump its a very difficult thing to stand up to a president  any president  in the oval office i dont doubt that the new chairman of the joint chiefs is committed to the constitution but he hasnt yet been tested
notable that he didnt answer this
his background as an israeli prison guard

thanks for the response and your time today 

awesome reporting
donald trump depicted as a successful businessman was a charade in 20152016 he was wealthy because hundreds of millions of his fathers money kept propping him up despite his utter failures 6 bankruptcies the apprentice was the ultimate propaganda tool which the producer admitted recast this troubled businessman as someone at the top of his game america believed it deeply enough so that in 2016 enough people voted for him to sway the electoral college in his favor

that was bad enough but by 2020 wed had 4 years of his malfeasance on display a truly horrible president he took credit for obamas phenomenal economic recovery work and then proceeded to stress that economy with a massive tax break to the wealthy destabilizing tariff wars with china and then a total blunder with handling the pandemic causing far more deaths and economic ramifications

fewer people shouldve voted for trump in 2020 the fact that he had more votes was simply astonishing and deeply troubling this really shows how badly americas society has been damaged by disinformation too many people in information silos believing without any critical thinking donald trump created a maga toxic cult that has millions captive to him enough that despite his failed coup attempt and getting caught redhanded with a classified documents theft scandal hes still supremely popular among republicans insanity

while its great that generals such as mark milley held the line and were ready to keep donald trump from making severe mistakes what good is this going to do if donald trump is back in office because of a successful disinformation campaign against president biden russia is still helping him and so is china
the powers of the president had been treated with reverence in years past and careful discretion for the most part donald trump threw all of that out the window like a gold prospector on private land where the owners are out of the country for some undetermined time he hacked away at every vulnerable nature of the presidency for profit political favors and power grabbing

what donald trump did raised numerous alarms it was my impression that there would be a strong initiative to enact more guardrails to prevent future ambitious presidents from doing the same thing but ive not seen or heard much at all donald trumps coup attempt was hastily done and his maga supporter assault on the capitol fraught with problems it took way too long for him to be held accountable and now the manipulation of state election legislation by republicans has further compromised fairness and balance coupled with the continued perpetuation of so much misinformation and disinformation too many americans are believing complete falsehoods and will eagerly vote for trump again

if trump gets a 2nd term our nation is done the republican party is a rogue institution that is hellbent on converting america to a christofascist autocratic regime and they will do it because conventional governance is something theyve long been deficient at performing

donald trump should not be on the political ticket for 2024 and it infuriates me how people talking about it like its a certainty is there no prescription possible to end this charade if donald trump is convicted of a felony he shouldnt be able to run the fact that he fostered an attempted coup to overturn the election results should qualify as a 14th amendment violation and bar him from the ballot why is this not getting far more traction than it already is

thank you for your reply look forward to reading more of your stories
  was a charade in 20152016 

you know trump may have back channel financial support from organized crime and russia that cannot be made public for obvious reasons
 it was my impression that there would be a strong initiative to enact more guardrails to prevent future ambitious presidents from doing the same thing

i think any such initiative would only be successful if the supreme court were onboard and im not sure they want to limit the power there are a few of them who support the unitary executive idea
i wouldnt doubt it im convinced donald trump has committed money laundering for russia oligarchs and saudi royality
yes youre right this is a major problem the scotus is supremely skewed to the farright six to three its a very bad dynamic that needs fixing as we come to find at least four justices have indulged in bribery with clarence thomas and samuel alito at the top of the heap gorsuch and roberts to follow

we were supposed to have a judicial reform act put into action but that never happened
 we were supposed to have a judicial reform act put into action but that never happened

and it would come under judicial review even so which means the supreme court would have to be ok with the act for it to become effective"

great news in johnston ia three current school board members are connected to moms for liberty and the rightwing organization only needed to win one seat tonight to gain full control of the school board they lost all four seats setting up a progressive majority instead

randy renstrom randyrenstrombskysocial
so i just found out that i won a seat at my local school board  inner ring suburb of minneapolis 

my platform was

    dont ban books

    love all our students and staff especially those that are different lgbtqia racial or religious minorities etc

    we do need to get these kids reading and doing math again
for a brief time tonight the entire front page is filled with stories about dems winning and almost none about trump

i welcome the break and pray it could predict a future we still see one day
man im rooting hard for andy beshear really a model of democrat leadership in a red state
huge win democrat schuyler vanvalkenburg has beaten republican siobhan dunnavant in the virginia senate district 16 this is a massive and needed win for the democrats to hold the virginia senate this is awful for the republicans and glenn youngkin

httpswwwthreadsnetharryjsissonpostczxcndfr19eigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq
the delusions that conservatives have over abortion rights are insane theyve somehow convinced themselves that liberals want to kill the fetus at 32 weeks because all they hear are bad faith arguments from republicans
get out and vote like your life depends on it lets give fascism the boot
voted against three moms for liberty school board candidates today in my town turnout looks poor and their m4l affiliation was kept sorta stealth ie not on their main campaign pages 

im not optimistic my own damn fault should have campaigned and helped more with organizing

 rtate reeves leads the mississippi governors race presley putting up a good showing but likely not enough to win runoff still a possibility

 ddaniel mccaffery leads in the pennsylvania supreme court race

 dems appear to be having a good night in new jersey flipping some trump held districts

 maine establishes a right to repair law but appears to reject a public utility company
when my husband went to vote today in oh the church that is our polling place had a bunch of vote no on issue one signs planted in their devilstrip

jokes on them someone must have complained to the board of elections because they were gone by the time i went to put my vote in

vote yes on issue 12 everyone lets fucking do this
i am over the moon with these results tonight my ballot in iowa had only one contested election which was for my school board district representative never in the history of this school district has there been campaigning for these seats and elections usually had 250 voters or less for the first time ever a pac rolled in to heavily fund four candidates that literally ran on a platform of banning books eliminating diversitysel training and forbidding any lgbtq anything throughout the district we had signs everywhere neighborhood canvassing and textphone solicitations you would have thought this was a presidential election year unbelievably thousands of people showed up to vote this year and every one of these pacfunded candidates was defeated by people voting for dignity and respect thank you to everyone who is out there voting against fear and hatred and truly understanding how important even these small elections are
another happy bit of news

justice scalias daughter meg bryce whose kids arent even in public school ran for the school board and lost to allison spillman the progressive mother of five public school kids including one trans daughter and a neurodivergent son and who is pretty much bryces polar opposite on policy issues

coming from deep red ohio here i dont know about other counties but my school board is going to be 23 democrats first time in i dont know how long at least 20 years the mayors race in my city is also neck and neck and our city council will be 23ish democrat too for the first time in my life i have some hope for ohio big win for the left tonight in ohio
the fact that republicans tried to cheat ohio voters earlier this year by raising the threshold makes it that much sweeter congrats ohio
major projection 

democrat michael feggans has defeated gop del karen greenhalgh in virginias hd97

this gives democrats at least 51 seats in the house of delegates for a majority 

gov youngkin is looking at a double brick wall now

httpsxcomsamshirazimstatus1722101953256100158s46taelmn7gnisfd3jue9wjuaa

there it is virginias back to trending blue after a one year blip
key points

 desantis screwed himself with his 6 week abortion ban any attempt for office higher than florida is over even trump is trying to backtrack on abortion but we have to remind voters that he installed 3 supreme court judges that overturned roe and made abortion illegal in half the country

 republican attempts for a moderate abortion limit are a smokescreen they will always try and go further its telling that they went from wanting to give it back to the states to wanting a federal abortion limit

 the divide between what republican primary voters and what general voters want in terms of abortion couldnt be more stark democrats must aim to make that divide as clear as possible to voters and its essential that dems make republican candidates views on abortion during the primaries well known that involves asking every republican running for office what their abortion policy is

the catch 22 of republican primaries any candidate extreme enough to win a primary is too extreme for general voters

bonus point driving a wedge between the evangelical voters and the republicans who dont want a federal abortion ban would be a great way to depress their turnout
the fact that all these races va ohio kentucky all being called so early is fucking beautiful guys 

dont let that ny times poll keep you down dems can win and are winning lets keep it up
repubs severely underestimated the impact of dobbs they might be fucked for a long time
nyt is saying ohio likely passes issues 1 and 2 its amazing how unpopular republican policies are but they keep insisting on it and its especially fucking amazing how federal democrats arent seizing on this incredibly popular policy
i made this account to say if you live in ohio  

yes on 1 to protect reproductive freedom

yes on 2 to end prohibition

go vote
the state of rconservative right now

one poster saying they need to drop the abortion issue cause its killing them in elections

another poster responds by pretty much calling him a baby killer


thats the thing republican cant run on abortion but they cant drop it either cause you have have a big portion of the base that wont accept any concession on abortion go easy on abortion you lose them

go hardline you lose the more moderatesane voters
democrats need to run so hard on abortion these next few years lol
bidens takeaway from tonight is simple abortion right abortion rights abortion rights that needs to be his message for the next year
new jersey democrats notch big legislative winshttpswwwpoliticocomnews20231108newjerseydemocratswinselections00126029

facing republican attacks on cultural issues democrats stuck to pocketbook issues in statewide elections new jersey democrats not only managed to hold onto their state legislative majorities tuesday night but expand them this is a big night for democrats gov phil murphy told nj spotlight news
gop lose control of virginia house

senate and house now belong to democrats there will be no 15 week abortion ban in virginia

also another great bellwether indicator for the dems to go with kentucky and ohio that they are more popular than the gop

get fucked doomers
pennsylvania having a 52 democratic supreme court is a huge win for democracy a swing state with a supreme court protecting us from trump and republicans gerrymandering is great news
did you know that the fastest growing voting block in the united states are people that the republican party has irreversibly pissed off
9010 yes on abortion in ohio ages 1824 in exit polls gop fucked when the boomers finally fuck off
rconservatives 4th 911
the weird thing about our politics in 2023 is that republicans will not under any circumstance modify unpopular positions on this like abortions lgbtq rights or opposition to unions

their response is going to be a more voter suppression b more violence and intimidation c more disinformation

the do not try to persuade the electorate they try to defeat the electorate
another big win for democrats in virginia hd65 with josh cole securing victory 

this means democrats will have at least 50 seats in house of delegates 

need to win one of following for majority

dems win pa supreme court race just called by nyt
dems lock up 51 seats in va house

dems control both houses

youngkin shamed in public
i hope glenn youngkin spilled beer on his patagonia vest tonight
the top elected republican designed a system to alert his son in real time that hes jacking off it should be no surprise that america is rejecting these creeps
i hope mike johnson and his son are monitoring each other watching the gop get fucked tonight
im just a drunk ohioan crying over here because i was pregnant when roe v wade was overturned and i remember being so fucking afraid i am glad that other individuals will not have to have as much fear as i did lets take our home back

polling for abortion access and weed was pretty fucking strong leading into this for ohio  i think both are going to pass
ds should work to get abortion referendums on the ballot in as many states as possible in 2024
holy hell republicans got screwed in ohio  abortions and now legal pot  well done ohio
do you think anyone in the republican party is starting to realize just how many groups of people the gop has pissed off over the years and how they might have hit the point of no return for many of them
moms for liberty endorsed candidates lost in the charlotte school board elections
did my part in nj there were actually a few young people besides myself at my polling location i will not miss a vote against fascism and anti womens rights

voter of a competitive district in va checking in im so fucking nervous about these elections
in my district albuquerque we have a moms for liberty fascist running for the school board 

my daughter is in this school district so ive encouraged everyone to vote i even wrote a letter about her and posted it on the doors of everyone in my apartment complex giving them instructions on how to vote 

i really hope peggy mulleraragon loses today
democrats have a clear path to victory nationwide abortion unions legalize weed  dems need to beat that into voters heads and make republicans go on record on these issues
abortion unions weed healthcare democrats got a platform for 2024
 dems survive in the executive race in allegheny county pittsburgh this matters for local issues more on that but also for elections 
 
 a gop win here would have tipped the board of election to the gop and one of the gop members is a fake trump elector that wont happen

httpstwittercomtanielstatus1722091588757631293
that moment when republicans remember women can vote
city of spokane wa just went from purple to firmly blue tonight
if youre in ohio and you are mad that abortion is legal at least now you can smoke enough weed to not care anymore
the midterms were not a bellwether for 2024 guys neither were all the special elections that dems overperformed in guys last night was just a fluke too guys this doesnt mean anything for 2024 guys it means nothing guys dems are doomed guys

republicans the media and general doomers
republicans in ohiohttpswwwdispatchcomstorynewspolitics20231108ohiorepublicansmakeplansaftervotersapproveissue1issue271498030007 are already planning to push back against the prochoice and promarijuana initiatives that passed yesterday for marijuana they want tax revenue to go towards building more prisons and they want to place limits on thc they want ohio to be known for selling bad weed

oh senate president matt huffman r had this to say on the prochoice victory

this isnt the end it is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace issue 1
deleted my last post because i said it wrong lol

democrats retain control of virginia senate 

this means an abortion ban will not pass in virginia
early results are promising for dems to take back control from the moms for liberty aligned school board in central bucks pa
im so proud of my fellow ohioans  looks like we get weed and bodily autonomy lets fucking go baby

re swift

taylor swift is encouraging her pack of swifties to head to the polls on election day

voters gonna vote swift wrote in a post to her 275 million instagram followers riffing off the lyrics to her hit single shake it off

in the post she encouraged those registered to vote in colorado kentucky maine mississippi new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania texas and virginia to use your voice and directed them to the nonpartisan voter advocacy group voteorg for more information

uh yeah ok i think maybe im good on my options for now thanks though
remember when roe was overturned and republicans said that by the 2022 midterms people would have moved on and stopped caring

there are still a lot of votes left to count but its looking very good for democratic chances of holding the virginia state senate

if that holds up it would mean republicans failed to win full control of state government  cant ban abortion  restrict voting rights

httpstwittercompoliticswolfstatus1722067116545687681
so ohio is gonna pass abortion access and legalize weed awesome
based on referendum results in ohio it looks like about 20 of trump voters are willing to cross party lines and vote for abortions protections when its put up to a vote if that doesnt convince gop politicians not to run on this issue i dont know what will

ohio legalizing marijuana ohio enshrining abortion rights in their state constitution

im probably missing a few things but what an amazing night
yougkin aimed for a conservative trifecta but got rekt instead good stuff
democrats are in disarray as these election results of democrats winning all over must be just more bad news for joe biden who in this poll that vastly oversampled republicans he has low poll numbers

producers in absolute shambles
in my local school district race the incumbent is holding off the moms for liberty candidate by 300 votes really hope that lead holds
its been a very good day for the democrats but a very bad day for the democratic president

wow you all werent kidding just switched to cnn and they led off with that after virginia flipped
lmao conservatives on twitter are crying about the recent election being rigged everything is rigged when i lose
i want to point out something important in the ohio results despite abortion and marijuana have near identical percentages of the vote the actual results arent even close to identical in urban counties marijuana ran behind abortion by around 5 in rural countries marijuana ran ahead of abortion by around 10 a good example is champaign county this is part of the gop heartland it voted by trump with 73 of the vote this is jim jordans home baseits part of his district and is from this county and hasnt voted democratic since 1964and has only voted democratic 3 times since 1856 the county was 58 no on the right to abortion on marijuana yes won with 52 of the vote
with this abortion issue backfiring on republicans and the speaker noporn signaling hes going after medicare and social security 2024 is shaping up to be a blue wave
the american voter paradox sure ill vote for weed and womens reproductive rights by referendum into state law or constitution but ill also vote for the politicians who proudly boast in being threats towards both no matter what
get fucked rconservative

also the media joe biden is definitely going to lose the 2024 election in a year did you see that one nyt poll trust us its all over democrats in disarray

wasserman

ive seen enough in a victory for the prochoice side ohio issue 1 a measure to establish a right to an abortion in the state constitution passes
why did the trump presidency feel like such a long slog but we are already a year away from the 2024 election 
just a thought of hope i wanted to share 

people like wassermann may be the one hope we have for reigning in these news channels that are trying to drag out every election night as long as possible when he calls something before the major networks people listen and tune out because they dont want to see the bullshit drag on longer than it should 

we owe wasserman a big thanks for his fast and accurate calls hes breaking the spell
this is why i dont trust the polls showing biden being down bigtime vs trump the gop has done horribly these past two elections and their stances are not winning stances with the public
once again if republican policies are put to a straight updown vote like they were in ohio they eat absolute shit  that party is only relevant thanks to voter suppression and gerrymandering

how democrats wiping the table with republicans like just utterly demolishing them is bad for biden
all in all a horrible election for the gop and thus a good election for americans
the media was never able to defeat trump they never knew how

the people defeated trump in 2020 and they did before in 2018 and again in 2022 and 2021 and tonight

and theyll do it one more time in 2024 with the media kicking and screaming every step of the way
imagine your governor getting caught taking millions of your tax payer dollars to build a volleyball facility for a football players daughter and then voting for them anyways what the hell mississippi
bravo to virginia the democrats have kept the senate and have flipped control of the state house youngkin now has zero chance of banning abortion in virginia tonight has been a huge night for americas only prodemocracy party

say it with me republicans     
    
  
abortion is a losing issue
the results tonight vindicate my criticism of that dumbass early poll people were swinging around 

this is an off year election low turnout local elections the gops specialty and they got destroyed

2024 with trump at the head of the gop ticket is going to be a bloodbath if the results of tonight are any indication gop are celebrating some wins in red states most of the country write off as deeep red the gazaisrael thing hurt bidens polling but the reality is is that most americans care more about maintaining their rights domestically than throwing them all the way to spite bidens israeli support by letting the gop run over us in elections

just voted along with my 3 adult kids for andy beshear and other dems in kentucky voting is too important at every level to not do it every time
voted this morning and accidentally locked myself out of my car
predictions

nj dems hold both houses

va dems flip the house hold the senate both with very narrow margins 2122 senate seats 5152 house

ky beshear wins by a comically tiny margin that leads to cameron successfully asking for a recountdragging out the tabulation process with further challenges

ms 10 pointish reeves win

oh 54y46n for issue 1 60y40n for issue 2

pa dems win the open supreme court seat
just voted yes on 1 and 2 in ohio seemingly every person voting with me was under 35
republicans refuse to learn that abortion is a losing issue for them
yeah lets break down bidens approval rating numbers for the 15th time
heres hoping ohio issue 1 stays above 60 yes just to further rub salt in the wound
andy wins reelection ohio enshrines abortion rights in their constitution and seems likely to legalize weed

no matter what anyone else says this is a good fuckin night
trump won the presidency in 2016 and ever since the dems have been doing well in every election cycle since 2018 in 2018 they won back the house in 2020 they won the presidency and senate in 2022 the red wave didnt materialize and now they won the kentucky governor race and the abortion amendment in ohio
not to diminish how much is at stake but does anyone else just get absolutely pumped up on election nights its like a super bowl for me its great seeing republicans hateful messages lose in a double off election year and every other year
lets not forget what else beshear did for kentucky recently that probably bumped his numbers legalized medical marijuana nd sports betting
political science majors unite this feels like march madness
this should be the nail in the coffin for polls this far out from elections  there is literally no point in doing them  seriously
ohio a now mostly red state just once again showed republicans that continuing to put their chips down against abortion rights is utterly asinine
this seems like yet another night of dem overperformance in the face of polls saying the gop totally has a massive edge in this environment something is just seemingly being missed by polling outfits right now
859 pm projection democrats have won the virginia senate  aaron rouse d wins seat 21 and the majority

current count  21 dem 15 gop 4 und
ohio just enshrined abortion rights called at 9 pm
legit question is there something fundamentally statistically wrong with the ways pollsters are getting their data these days like only calling landline phones or using newspaper websites or something

why are polls seemingly underestimating democratic success lately

edit yall have some good and interesting points thank you
dems overperforming holding ground in a lot of races but heres how this is bad for bidens
america runs from youngkin
cnn called it beauty clark thank you ohio again for voting the right way on the second issue 1 in three months
a former trump communications director just said on cnn election deniers go down and trump is a drag on the ticket
fox news is currently discussing the necessity of republicans voting early and voting by mail oh how the tables have turned
vivek abortion should be left to the states
every state thats voted on the issue ends up proabortion
vivek we need to communicate better other options 

the abortion issue is over americans want access to abortions in some fashion drop the issue the evangelicals dont have anywhere else to go
remember ohioansissue 2 was not a constitutional amendment republicans get to screw it up and they are going to want to punish you for issue 1
turns out that people want to be respected trusted to make their own decisions and empowered by government instead of being limited by it

or you know american values
legalization in ohio wins ap race call at 931 pm on nov 7 2023

indiana is now surrounded by states with legalization fuck my state
its kind of hilarious that fox news isnt even covering the elections they dont want their viewers to know how bad republicans are doing haha
not the biggest news but hogsett  d defeated shreve  r by around 20 in indianapolis it was one of the most expensive mayoral races in indianapolis history and shreve was pretty soundly defeated
youngkin about to lose everything in virginia cnn bout to call him a favorite vs biden as well i think
on the one hand beshear is very much a local candidate dad was governor is kentucky through and through can talk to regular kentuckians because he is a regular kentuckian etc that said he also has a knack for making progressive policies palatable to the exact sort of people who like dem policies but have been conditioned to hate democrats will be curious to see if he starts trying to build a national profile he may have a future beyond kentucky
the dem bench is strong for 2028 onward whitmer shapiro moore  beshear etc exciting
2028 is going to be huge for democrats beshear shapiro pa newsome and you also have whitmer as well
its sort of a weird crossover but taylor swifts voting message reminded me that the governor of virginia glenn youngkin was the coceo of the carlyle group when it helped scooter braun buy big machine records and subsequently her back catalogue
obama had similar poll results in 2011 like what biden is getting right now but dems never performed like this during his presidency in off elections or even midterms
always brightens my mood to see maga get beat all of you that voted today this stranger thanks you we are in this together these limp dick fascists aint shit lets keep it up
i cannot reiterate how much we are so fucking back
cnn running out all the failed republican candidates tonight
theyre trying to put the recreational marijuana ballot initiative and the abortion one for 2024 in florida but the attorney general can ask the state supreme court to block it
there really is nothing trump could do that would make his supporters not vote for him and thats fucking terrifying vote like your life depends on it
dems win the supreme court seat in pennsylvania another huge win
they called the pennsylvania supreme court seat for the democrats another big win
people in the rvirginia elections thread are happy about at minimum abortion rights in virginia are protectedand out comes the people whining about now theyll restrict guns and the 2a like it was written by jesus himself
the conservative sub is rolling out misinformation that they are going to be aborting viable babies at birth in ohio now
seeing whats happening biden and other dem candidates have to really hammer home that abortion is on the ballot next year  republicans keep losing the abortion votes even in deep red areas hammer it the fuck home
youngkin was legitimately my biggest fear for a long time after 2021 because i believed he represented a viable form of trumpismsomething that could at least in theory outlast his position trumpism without trump

at this point weve pretty much confirmed ittrumpism cannot work without trump desantis is not an effective model youngkin cant make it work and i overall dont think it works with trump its lost every single election since 2016 so there is a sliver of hope however faint of this kind of crap either getting abandoned or failing repeatedly every election until it dies out
va state house flipped baby

literally a clean sweep for the dems aside from ms and that was always a massive stretch goal
glenn younkin  doesnt shake the ketchup bottle before using it and actually kind of likes the watery preketchup that comes out
im hoping i can type this next year
cnn
biden wins reelection heres why thats bad news for biden
the week is nov 20th 2024 cnn has just released a national poll showing trump ahead of biden by 10 points they debate if this spells the end of the biden presidency meanwhile presidentelect biden is celebrating thanksgiving with family after successfully winning reelection two weeks before he splits some pumpkin pie with his son hunter cnn pivots to a live response by a republican congressman from rural indiana who wonders if this an impeachable offense
really glad va redeemed itself from the youngkin mistake especially since im moving back there soon and dont want to raise kids in a fascist hellhole
looking at fox news i see hardly any videos on the election almost as if they didnt happen

just the usual headlines about biden hunter biden israel and so on
i always hope for fun meltdowns from the conservative sub on these nights but they usually do this thing where they have relatively levelheaded posts for a couple days and then start doing the batshit crazy stuff a couple days later there have been some watchlistworthy posts on the abortion result though
democrats also flipping the superior court in pennsylvania step below supreme court a 2 seat gain for the dems
here in pa allegheny county pittsburgh elected sara innamorato as the first woman ever to be its executive shes a young progressive ally of john fetterman and summer lee
ap richmond va ap  virginia democrats who campaigned on protecting abortion rights swept tuesdays legislative elections retaking full control of the general assembly after two years of divided power
im excited to watch the republicans learn absolutely nothing from this
so glad the local fascist bully who modeled his campaign after trump including the flags and signs was decisively defeated im sure he will rant and scream about it being fixed because he had a ton of signs around town

sorry asshole signs dont vote 

todays a good day
i just started sobbing with joy when i saw issue 1 got projected to pass in ohio 

not to get too personal but i had a bilateral salpingectomy fallopian tube removal a year ago due to the roe overturn and ohios subsequent ban so i cant get pregnant anymore 

but it was so important for my husband and me to vote to give healthcare rights to all of my fellow ohioans even though this particular part longer applied to us personally 

im just overjoyed that this has passed
voted in early voting last week here in kentucky 

even early voting was steady hoping for a big turnout 

beshear has done so much during 3 major disasters during his term i hope people will remember that over outrage politics which is all it seems mr cameron has in his corner
just voted in ky but there wasnt many there voting 
1 for andy fingers crossed
on my way to vote for beshear in kentucky it would be a huge loss for kentucky to not have him for another term 

my dream scenario is him running in two years when mcconnell probably doesnt run again
ohio issue 1 on abortion is definitely going to pass a similar amendment passed in kansas last year
i had food poisoning past two days still went and voted for abortion to be legal and rec weed in ohio
i did my part in kentucky woo
ill laugh my ass off if issue 1 passes by  60
ohio voters love abortion and legal weed but vote overwhelmingly for republicans no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american voter
theres a decent chance prop 1 wins by more than 60 of the vote at this point which is crazy in ohio
im starting to think that taking away rights from women isnt the big vote getter that republicans thought it would be maybe their backup plan of nominating a man who will almost certainly be in prison by election day will get them across the finish line
democrats are going to make abortion the issue in 2024 pres race
i think we can say at minimum that any concerns that tonight would show the democrats are in total disarray were completely overblownagain it just doesnt seem that we are seeing many red flags or worrying signs for 2024 anywhere the dems may not sweep the night but so far it doesnt seem the republicans have gotten their shit together at all
honestly it would be funny if they had all that hoopla in august about changing the amendment threshold to 60 to stop issue 1 and issue 1 exceeds that threshold anyway
one of the must wins in va senate was called for dems was a hold
im just some random person on the internet who probably doesnt know shit but i dont think antiabortion is a winning stance for the gop
update in ohio issue 1

yes  656

no  344

another red state is about to keep abortion legal

republican leaders dont care one bit what the majority wants  every chance they get theyll lie and cheat and put their religious views before the wishes of the people

just look at who the tone deaf republicans chose to lead the house
dems need to adopt whatever message beshear is speaking

congrats on ohio voters for passing issue 1 but the ohio gop are some of the scummiest humans on earth feels like theyll still find a way to fuck over the majority of voters and keep abortion illegal really hope im wrong
all im seeing is telling me that republicans have yet to figure out how wrong they are on abortion
its looking increasingly likely that the polls dooming that virginia was going to be a gop trifecta were not only wrong but the gop is on track to lose the state house
ohio is so perplexing liberal on social issues but basically north florida on republican candidates
kentucky we did it  fucking yes  tears in my eyes ahhhh
the fact that kentucky was called before 9pm a 20 republican state is absolutely insane amazing
abortion will likely be on the ballot in arizona next year  thats a big help for biden
democrats are having a fantastic night tonight cant wait to see why its bad for joe biden in tomorrow headlines 

in all seriousness im starting to feel somewhat confident about next years presidential election
man what a night for democrats this is some _good_ stuff
its 9 pm est heres where things stand

andy beshear has just been called by the nyt as winner of the kentucky governors race virginia senate is 1010 d and r but dems are expected to hold it in the virginia house 31d27r ohio has voted to to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution tate reeves has a tight lead in the mississippi governors race
nyt saying ohio marijuana very likely to pass now
ohio issue 1 has passed 

lets fucking go
va dems look to take senate if races hold
ohio also legalizes marijuana
just saying im watching cbs coverage and dont currently want to kill myself it seems that some of you watching cnn feel differently

you are allowed to change the channel
yo if democrats have any brains at all theyll make sure they do everything in their power to make the general about abortion rights this has proven a gigantic loser for republicans and the american people are pissed about it
philly suburbs rejected the maga judge hard
people agree so much more on the issues than they do on who should represent them makes me think we should have more direct ballot initiatives for the voters to decide issues and bypass politicians altogether
is it just me or does the democrats have a really good chance at winning the virginia house of delegates 

they seems close to 50 if you include the uncalled lean democratic races
remember that mcconnell and beshear were both elected by the same electorate

candidates with character matter  you see it with andy
i want to introduce yall to the dem leader in the va senate louise lucas her twitter is a delight she clearly has a deep dislike of youngkin

overturning roe v wade has cost the republicans every election for the foreseeable future
cameron conceded at least
apparently republicans dont think abortion is an issue lmao
understated state of the night is new jersey gop getting absolutely slaughtered there and they were thinking they might win a chamber in the state legislature not that long ago too
biden is like a sponge soaking up all the negativity while the rest of the dems overperforms
mississippi was always going to be far fetched

virginia ohio and kentucky are the true bellwethers and they all went far better than the media thought for dems
republicans should switch to pro choice because they just got fucked raw
ap and nyt have called the allegheny county executive pittsburgh race for sara innamorato

much smaller race than some of the marquee ones tonight but as a pittsburgher this is super exciting saras an extremely progressive candidate and the first woman to ever hold this position
wasserman just said that va house of delegates at minimum is looking like a tie perhaps dems take sole possession of it
dear republicansthank you please keep doing exactly what youre doing its working out very well
lemme guess every race where the republican won was fair every race where the democrat won was rigged and stolen
christie  i support states rights to choose but i would sign a ban if i got 60 votes 

x200b

pretty clear position to me
wait until tomorrow when trump blames the gop loses in va on youngkins name sounding chinese hes done it before lol
gibson up around 900 votes now dems closing in on 51 for va house
reports are saying democrats are winning 53 seats right now in the va assembly
turns out that people want to be respected trusted to make their own decisions and empowered by government instead of being limited by it

or you know american values
the last time i watched a guy named glenn take a beating this bad jeffery dean morgan was smiling
why the hell are so many of you watching cnn its trash and not in touch with either party
congratulations ohio on sucking less than you did before
cnn is in fucking bizzaro world tonight their somehow making fox look in touch with reality

they get the dems pretty much running the table and having a great off year election night and all they can talk about is a stupid poll or that none of this matters
i think va house is going to be 53 dems and 47 gop when its all done youngkin invested so much to trying to flip both house and senate so he can ban abortion and failed miserably how many more years until this ahole is out of office
i cant wait for nate silvers meltdown about how polling is reliable and important after what happened in virginia
nj pretty much mopped the floor with the gop today
dark brandon strikes again
the only thing rs won tonight is cnn 
pollsters in shambles maga in tears cnnnyt heres how the gop can still sweep
youngkin is effectively a lame duck in virginia couldnt happen to a better person

watching glenn youngkins presidential ambitions completely crumble tonight has been satisfying and absolutely hilarious im really looking forward to the next few days of republicans coping really hard with tonights results
as a virginian my opinion of youngkin actually went up after tonight hes done more damage to the va gop than anyone else in the last 2 years so thats something
i wonder if we need to do more investigations into hunter bidens laptop to find out the truth of why dems are mopping the floor with republicans
im not a poll truther i do think theres value in representative polls or trying to get a good sample but ultimately its a year out and we have a lot of actual election data to draw from and it seems to me thats more helpful at this point in time 

i think in general something is just weird i think the disconnect between the polls the media and the actual boots on the ground is extremely wide 

if bad polls make dems freak out and work hard i guess thats a good thing and we can keep being energized and engaged i dont know its a good night for us tonight and lets enjoy the fact that voters are coming out over and over hopeful
havent seen much talk about pa electing a dem to their supreme court another w for dems tonight
gop in the next couple of hours is going to be saying that they need to regroup and rethink their strategy only to then learn nothing and go all in on their bs

a tale as old as the gop itself
susanna gibson in virginias 57th is barely winning by 900 votes as of 1134pm 

she was made famous nationally because some ass leaked a video of her having sex with her husband
hey republicans in ohio you shitting bricks yet
ohioan here good job ohio
lol at rconservative  they are turning on each other
looks like youngkins strategy to tightrope the abortion issues was a big failure yesterday and cost the gop the house in va youngkins idea of a 15 week abortion limit wasnt conservative enough to mobilize conservative voters and independentsdems dont trust that bullshit because we know you give the gop full power abortion ban will be rammed through into law as soon as possible next year the trump campaign will do everything to distance themselves from the abortion issue but the country needs to be reminded that it was trump decision to appoint 3 justices that voted to overturn roe and that trump took credit for it when it happened
the results are preliminary but a moms for libertyadjacent candidate probably lost in my area so thats nice
turnout this year in my county was over 40 just ten years ago the offyear turnout was 20 

lets keep up the momentum
a big night for democrats tuesday in state races only highlighted the struggles joe biden faces in 2024  cnn


ohio we want weed and abortion

ohio i will still vote gop

this country is dumb
every girl i know dreams of carrying a pregnancy to term just so she can have an abortion at the last second thats totally a thing that happens 
people watching cnn and didnt know they were purchased by a conservative who wants to be murdoch  surprised pikachu face  really people it happened two years ago
rs in ohio already signaling that theyll put abortion on the ballot again to repeal what passed tonight read the room fellas people arent a fan of your policies they only vote for you guys because they hate dems
how will democrats ever recover from their gigantic wins in tonights elections
cnn got there win biden lost deep blue mississippi at this rate he might not even carry california if he cant win in a liberal bastion like mississippi
the trump fashioned supreme court snuffed out the right of women to decide about their own healthcare  roe v wade told women you cannot make your own decision on abortion now in states across america women are saying  we will decide and throwing out of office those who took away their freedom 20  of republican women are pro choice and 70 of independents voters  are pro choice for many of those voters this is their keystone issue while trump thinks he crushed the right of women with his 3  sc  appointments he failed what he did was stir women to vote  like never before
hannity just now democrats are trying to scare women into thinking republicans dont want abortion legal under any circumstances  
  
 brian stelterhttpstwittercombrianstelterstatus1722076225835774022 no longer welcome on foxlite cnn

after tonight fox is already trying to recast decades of forcedbirtherism in the gop as ohhh we were only kidding please dont google speaker mike johnson
dark brandon ready 2024 you may doubt biden but dark brandon different ball game
checking in from ohio  early voted a couple weeks ago yes on both issue 1 and issue 2 will be watching the news anxiously tonight hoping for good results
ky proudly voted for andy again
california here i dont have anything to vote for so thanks to all of you in other states that are voting for sane candidates and legislation im especially hopeful for you ohioans whore voting on behalf of a womans right to bodily autonomy
funniest thing just happened to me just realized i was arguing with an anti biden pro trump guy who has anti fascist in his profile

i want to become a cable news talking head and make 250000 per year to say things like these results show that each party has a certain level of support
the real thing to watch for is do democrats continue to out perform polls across the country like they have been each election
my state is not perfect but if we vote to legalize recreational weed and allow my girlfriend to get an abortion if she wants to i will be really happy  please keep the high numbers for both
abortion rights at 652 yes marijuana at 574 yes both with 19 of the vote in
marijuana in ohio is decreasing  please god legalize it there so indiana can be influenced by this i need the boomer politicians here to take notice
its almost certain now abortion will be legal in ohio voted for by a large margin  what does that mean for 2024  women voted in a red state  get f trump
abortion student loans and saving entitlements for old people have to be the winning issues in 2024
who was dooming about va94 earlier the ap just called it for phil hernandez d
presley in the lead in mississippi 

stop the count
it is interesting to see people surprised at abortion doing better than weed by a good margin while they are accepted by younger people as handinhand with their belief system weed is really only getting steam as mainstream for maybe the last 15 years while abortion rights have been fought over for over 5 decades older voters are reliable and many are  pro choice its an older fight

im going to spend so much money in ohio if issue 2 passes
in ohio issue 1 abortion running 10 points ahead of issue 2 weed in urban counties

but in rural counties theyre even some people want to smoke weed but dont think you should have reproductive rights
deleted
ohio and kentucky so proud of you guys
i know the pa supreme commonwealth and superior court races arent that exciting given the rest of the stuff today but

holy moly if these current results hold pa is painting it blue tonight thats huge i voted because i was concerned about potential election fuckery again next year and its looking like others had the same thoughtsconcerns also even my rural red county is saying nope to red which is shocking
what it appears is that while biden may be unpopular in his own right it doesnt seem to be translating to people flocking to the gop the voters largely do not see them as an alternative this seems to be very difficult for the mainstream political media to understand
this country is becoming more blue and thats the way it should be
gop finding out that car theyve been chasing doesnt actually taste that good as it slowly backs over them
get absolutely fucked younkin
democrats win again despite polling saying otherwise about how close it would be almost like pollsters idea of the electorate is more and more obsolete every year
way to show out kentucky and ohio voters
get fucked republicans hope you enjoy the preview of 24
common fucking sense prevailed tonight in kentucky ohio and starting to look like virginia  way to go guys
i see all the good news  then remember im stuck in tennessee  
cnnmedia as a whole really needs to stop reading so much into like two polls a year out from 2024 lol
fox news got hannity kayleigh mcenany and charlie hunt on right now its like a challenge to see how many shitbags they can have on the screen at once
dems win again despite a slew of junk polls trying to keep us home

remember this when you hear nonsense about rfk jr leading
issue 2 ohio called by nbc news ohio will have legal weed
ramaswamy i support codifying into law mens sexual responsibility the hell does that mean
i dunno yall

tonights results brought down my systolic after that nytsienna poll

i know dems arent out of the woods yet but at least it shows theyre still very engaged
i made the mistake of turning on cnn why the fuck would they give ramaswamy any air time the fucker doesnt even vote and he should be nowhere near any elected office or even cable tv show
how many states does it need to happen before elected republicans realize abortion is a losing issue and when will voting republicans start voting out anyone that wants to remove it
dont pay attention to the polls just vote
outlets are starting to call issue 2 for oh now as a yes to legalize weed ohio showed the heck up today proud of you guys
god i hope next years election goes as smoothly as this
another republican state where weed passes and then theres pa just not passing it
this dude could wipe the floors against republicans in a national election he speaks rust belt in a way no candidate has since obama or maybe even bill clinton
already a better night for dems than many thought
beshear reelected

oh voted to protect abortion access and legalize marijuana

any other major callouts trying to catch up
look at andys compassion and genuine care for his people

that is what wins  always care  always respect  do those things and you can win anywhere

remember that when people say to check out and stop caring  keep caring keep pushing and anything is possible
god beshear would be such a strong national candidate so hed never win a primary
dang yall listening to andy beshears speech makes me want to live in kentucky i have never been so excited about road construction
beshear is spoken like a dude with some future political prospects moderately left who rejects the far right without being inflammatory cares about local and state issues liberal ideals but still spoken like a moderate
im pretty happy for our governor election outcome if nothing else

me and my wife did our part
from about an hour ago httpsapnewscomliveelection2023liveupdates

voting times at 4 precincts in mississippi county extended to 10 pm
a judge in mississippis largest county has extended voting times to 10 pm est at four voting precincts after they experienced ballot shortages and long lines  the four precincts where voting will be allowed until 10 pm est are byram city hall a united methodist church in raymond and wildwood baptist church and northside baptist church both in clinton
ohio passed prochoice and legalized marijuana in one night gg conservicucks
hopefully dems pull out va house
im so glad things are blowing up in the maga republicans faces
people saying beshear should run for president in 2028 and i had that thought too

and damn do i agree id love a president andy beshear

but i wonder if we could missing a possibility of him flipping a senate seat if he retains popularity in theory its a state focused federal seat and hes done well by staying statefocused in his campaign he could argue that hell go to dc to fight for kentuckys benefit

any thoughts senator beshear or president beshear both have a nice ring
control of the house in va looks like it may come down to district 57 where susanna gibson has a narrow lead will be interesting
god i wish i was as delusional as house republicans are about abortion 
i think even the most diehard pro life republicans have to be saying oh fuck right now
how did youngkins much touted some called brilliant plan to show voters that the democrats are the out of touch extremists on reproductive rights there was talk that it was going to pave a way forward for republicans in 2024 they were saying this was going to maybe save the gop and secure their future did it pan out
cnn key race alert the republican is still ahead in mississippi  
gee thanks jake
im definitely left leaning so i wouldnt consider myself a moderate but watching john tester speak and people like beshear gotta say i love these red state democratic politicians they do have a charm to them
interesting that the prooh marijuana side is now doing slightly better than the prochoice one 561 vs 555
fuuuck chris christie took it out of the hands of people

bruh sounds like a confederate in the south
i wish i could see jim jordan melting down right now haha
keep thinking you can run on banning abortions gop see how well that works out for you
all that matters about mississippi is the change in margin from 2020
even with republican most likely winning mississippi governor it should be worrisome for republicans its as close as it is in a very very solid red state
if i am doing my math right i think in the pa supreme court race the republican candidate needs about 65 of the remaining vote to come from behind and win  i dunno where the remaining votes are

the gop will win the governors race by a razor thing margin in mississippi and thats after polling places in jackson unfortunately and mysteriously ran out of ballots on election day
all these commentators saying that the rs need to do some introspection are going to be sorely disappointed

glad pa supreme court will remain 52 dem

since 2016 doing the bare minimum what is normal is now worth mentioning
i havent been proud of much in va lately but i sure am tonight just a shame youngkin wasnt on the ballot today im sure wed have told governor sweatervest what we think of him too
now we just have to wait for a cnn roundtable to explain how a dem majority in both chambers in va is bad news for joe biden
democrats sweeped the virginia house and senate but how worried should president biden be about our cnn poll
so proud of virginia dems showed up to keep the senate and maybe take the house
based on the 11 margin of error on cnns poll it seems like they used a sample of about 150 people that seems like an incredibly shitty poll

local election results for wilmington nc here 

in my municipal we saw democrats winning all 3 seats on the city council thus ousting 1 republican incumbent while handing one democratic incumbent another term in his seat 

our current mayor also a democrat ran unopposed and it was an easy win for him 

seems like republikkkans are having an awful night in the places that matter from the information ive seen so far
it took the republican on the cnn panel to finally bring up that trump is no spring chicken himself when it comes to age thats how you counter the age thing trump is just a few years younger

democrats flipping a trump 35 state assembly seathttpstwittercomwildsteinstatus1722078688936620191 in southern nj because why not

weird election night given bidens approval ratings
just a reminder youngkin won at the height of crt being the latest conservative boogeyman and when roe v wade was the law of the land trump was gone and scared racist suburban white women thought they were safe from gop craziness life comes at ya fast glen
im watching people in the conservative subreddit try to rationalize reproductive rights being popular

they seem to be under the impression that the winning move is to keep pushing for abortion bans but to start trying to do them incrementally to slowly make some more restrictive  they think that if you slowly make abortion more and more inaccessible that people will realize that they actually like them being banned

they dont get it at all

i have also seen one fairly thinly veiled call for violence or terrorism over this and a comment that is quite straightforward in its presentation of neonazi replacement theory
embarrassed to say because i live in a state with few chances of going blue i wasnt going to vote but we have local county elections today and all it takes is one bad actor so fuck em boss said i could leave early to do my civic duty
what a coincidence black districts in mississippi ran out of ballots hmm
overturning roe vs wade was the political blunder of the century they ignited a forest fire and theyre caught in the middle good luck in 2024 2028 and possibly 2032 republifascists

rip glenn youngkin presidential prospects oct 2023  nov 2023
virginia flipped both the house and senate youngkin can get fucked
i get the feeling that theres a new silent majority this silent majority dont take polls they just vote in them  thats why theres a presidential disconnect betwen bidens popularity and actual results  in every measure the democrats won this year

and if in 360 days or so that stays the case  joe biden will be reelected  if not by the landslide then bigger than 2020 margins especially if the r is who people think it will be again
cnn poll is correctno one is excited about biden 

we are excited about voting for dark brandon f you facists
voted in ohio today very smooth process really hoping that we can repeat the decisive victory from the special election

going to move to kentucky next year for college originally from there i hope andy pulls this out best governor that state has had in decades
one aspect i never considered before about winning governors seats is that it nicely sets up a senate or presidential run provided they are popular 

if beshear gets reelected and stays liked then a senate run is not out of the question and that would be a remarkable pick up for dems
just 3 things on the ballot here but it is important to keep a crazy off the school board  sex education is education  it says so in the name  also its hard to keep teachers around if we dont give the schools money

from politicohttpswwwpoliticocomliveupdates20231107electiondayearlyvotingresultselectionday00125817

compared to four years ago when states held similar elections the number of voters casting their ballots by mail or early in person has increased dramatically reflecting in part the lasting effects of the pandemic on voting habits and rule changes including in kentucky where more than 44000 voters cast ballots this year up from 2022  
but the extent to which any of those changes will have an electoral impact is unclear
i think i voted for a republican once twenty or thirty years ago other than that i used to always like to consider all candidates before making my choice

since the cheney administration i decided im never voting for a republican again and nothing and nobody since then has made me question that decision

my ballot for todays election had nothing but dems vs repubs so there was nothing to even think about i just filled in the circles made sure i put the ballot in the envelopes the right way and dropped it off in the collection box took longer to pick up my fries at mcds on the way home

 yes the va senate flipped back to dem control based on projections

the senate is already demcontrolled this will be a hold

a very critical hold
this should be the end of youngkins career

the guy paraded around for a week like this election was in the bag and openly bragged about how they could then ban abortion

he likely drove opposition voters in his hubris 

this is such a spectacular blunder
mikes son 100 has at least one burner and is cranking it on the regular

this is amazing maybe americans are finally fed up with the maga clown show
i literally just looked up who moms for liberty supported in my county and voted against them fuckin psychos
congratulations thats awesome
had me at dont ban books my local school board also rejected a couple evangelist that were trying to get in hopefully moms for liberty type candidates lost across the united states
the fact that you need congrats for common sense policy is a scary thing
there was that single story about the republican arrested for child porn before his election
get used to it this will happen every election for the foreseeable future and republicans and their corporate media propagandists wont understand why its happening

its glorious
woah this is the first ever link to threads i have seen in the wild
 this is awful for the republicans and glenn youngkin

you love to see it
correct just to explain a bit this was expected to be the 21st of 40 seats by probability for the senate if dems couldnt hold this its an awful sign if they held it it seems very likely they hold the senate and can stifle youngkins nonsense for the remainder of his term
after i saw the argument that democrats support post birth abortions up to a year kind of argument it was clear they are just frothing at the mouth enraged to the point where they will blatantly lie knowing no reasonable person would buy it like they straight up will say democrats support murdering 1 year old babies as abortion with zero evidence and all common sense telling everyone that is obviously false there is no bottom to how much they will lie on this issue
once you hear them use the term post birth abortion you know youre dealing with a moron
those who never remove their heads from their own asses inevitably come to believe the whole world smells like shit
none of their arguments are based in fact so they use irrational fear  illegals are voting in droves so we need to make it harder to vote  obama is coming for your guns so we need to make it easier for wife beaters to get a gun  gays want to convert your kids so we need to take away protections for them

edit spelling  dont type on your phone in the middle of the night
hey its not too late if you have time make some calls among friends and family and poor turnout usually doesnt favor dems but in off year elections all of this is harder to predict

sometimes the right only votes on election days and the left votes early

sometimes neither party is engaged

or you may have simply arrived at a low engagement time quite a few elections dont have long lines even with high turnout especially if there was solid early voting or you just beat the crowds

either way if youre upset consider if you have any options left at the last second
gotta give the legalization movement in oh credit for playing the long game and not accepting the corrupt monopoly rec system the republicans okd years back  best of luck to the oh ents

i saw one of them over there tonight acting completely shocked that prochoice is a popular position

and legalize marijuana take a look at the oh map for both abortion and mj they arent identical httpswwwcnncomelection2023resultsohio
this for all the prolife rhetoric none of those people thought through the consequences rights being taken away isnt popular 

i think biden will be fine if a his staff let him be himself and b he sticks to protecting rights personally i think the popularity polls are misleading hell never be super popular but hes competent and his heart is in the right place
spite is an incredible motivating force

walking around for 4 years pissing off everybody they could for shits and giggles sure built a lot of it
you mean pissing off just about half the population women of your country with the addition of lgbtq and allies is not a good idea for your campaign
82 under 29 according to the washington post
weve been watching youngkin strut around this whole last week acting like republicans taking the entire state legislature was a done deal

he was so confident that he was openly bragging about how they could ban abortion

this has got to be a case study in absolute stupidity
wait till they realize that the number of baby boomers goes down every year
yes but theyre working on that
if conservatives could just light a nice blunt instead of rage watching fox news our shit would be super good
if biden wins in 2024 the headlines will be biden wins reelection why thats bad for biden
its just a fucking farce cnn has spent the last hour talking about bad polling news for biden amidst this insanely good night for him and his party
i hope her popularity and voice has an impact on voting  the more the better
in the same exact time of obamas reelection campaign he was also behind in the polls and contrarians were saying he should step aside for hillary

republicans got their muffins waxed tonight
dems also dont sit at home and answer stupid land lines calls from dumb polls
turns out forcing married women to give birth to dead or nearlydead babies isnt a winning strategy its not just a bunch of 16 year olds out there getting knocked up

ask us anything

proof httpsimgurcomazbdg7yphttpsimgurcomazbdg7yp","the second paragraph in your intro makes this election sound like its just two runofthemill politicians going up against one another why do you and other media outlets not that you can answer for them insist on playing down the extreme risk the 45th presidentrapistinsurrectionistfraud poses for not only the existence of the united states of america but for the world in general forgive my hyperbole but i have to combat your constant ambivalence thank you
 why does the media wsj included continuously treat the risk that trump poses with kid gloves 
 why does it feel like journalism has devolved from uncovering the hidden truths to reporting unequivocal party talking points with the same sense of authenticity for example the insurrection attempt versus the weakatbest accusations pertaining to hunter biden who doesnt even hold a government position 
 what part does the media feel theyve played in the leadup to this horrific political landscape weve found ourselves in 
 if you dont make it clear that you oppose any and all attempts to subvert democracy why should anyone trust you
will your organization acknowledge the sound political reality that trumps rhetoric and behaviors perfectly fit the guise of historical fascists with the key differences only really being the modern media that allows his views to spread

httpswwwwisdcorgnewstrumpandfascismhttpswwwwisdcorgnewstrumpandfascism

can we acknowledge that teachings against these views were standard in the us in the 1940s and that the federal government even used to fund films which spoke against the very kind of rhetoric trump popularized  
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgaqynfqdz4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgaqynfqdz4  
330 in particular is a very important moment within this video

can we have an honest conversation about how dangerous this situation is how it has led people like myself who were raised by conservatives to wholly reject the party for sound and steady reasons that true patriotism should as a whole be rejecting this movement on principal alone regardless of some hypothetical shallow economic theory the gop tries to promote

when will the media finally wake up and report on the common sense nature of the problem we face and not merely address it as a normal competitive typical election we watched a coup attempt on live television just 25 years ago
is your commitment to a false equivalence in fair reporting going to contribute heavily to the further degradation of the republic  or will it just be a moderate contribution
will you start reporting accurately on what is at stake if trump wins
is the wsj so ideological that it will support trump despite his clear unsuitability for running the office
will you accurately report that one the candidates is a convicted rapist under 4 criminal indictments who attempted a multifaceted coup to permanently end the peaceful transition of power and american democracy despite knowing full well that hed lost the election
the wsj has a track record of biased reporting on climatehttpsjournalssagepubcomdoipdf1011770963662515595348

to what extent does being owned by news corp influence your coverage
will your coverage highlight how the future of democracy is at risk if trump is given another term in office
are there ways in which the wsj plans to question and cover trump and his campaign that differ from 2016 and 2020 if so how
your opinion page is quite right wing and often promotes alleged false hoods how do you reconcile that with your normal reporting are you willing to call them out objectively on their right wing leanings
why didnt it seem relevant to you to mention trumps current legal problems
why does the media wsj included insist on covering trumps candidacy as if its normal and not an authoritarian power grab
why does your publication insist on treating the republicans like actual productive candidates and this as being a traditional discussion of ideas and election one side is not only headed by a malicious fraud and demagogue inciting violence but is also filled with open christian nationalists and those who treat entire categories of people as nonentities how are you able to face yourself while reporting for a publication that leans heavily toward supporting that side
how do you reconcile the need to be objective while working for rupert murdoch
will you stop reporting with headlines what liberals dothink unless its actually a liberal authors submission adding to that what plans do the conservatives have forthcoming im interested in reading that   
what can journalists do to stop normalizing trumps speech patterns his comments are often massaged to appear less disjointed and jumbled can we stop glossing over his manner of speech ito impart a true sense of him speaking
has wsj covered project 2025
considering that wsj is owned by murdoch who also owns fox news why should we trust you to be impartial

im specifically referring to how fox got the largest fine in history for lying about 2020 election and how fox has such an incestuous relationship with trump and maga that their anchors were texting republican congressmen to vote for jim jordan just last week 

why should anyone trust you to be a legitimate news source in light of this
will the forced horse race perspective be successful at distracting me from the climate and global oligopoly situations
why are the media complicit in not challenging the return of fascism at every turn
how do you expect the current trump criminal trials to affect the election
is it relevant to spend money and time doing nation wide polls for president  with the winner take all rule for almost all states electoral votes doesnt the presidential race boil down to polling which ever 10 states were closest last time

did you both sides your coverage in 2016 or 2020 will the campaign frame for 2024 be different or the same will you primarily continue in a traditional  leftright frame or switch to a democracy vs autocracy frames please dont say you dont frame coverage
the wall street journal is an inherently fiscal publication  and conservative policies tend to be more fiscally popular

how can wsj be a reliable nonbiased news source in this or any election
on february 14 2021 the wsj editorial board wrote1

 mr trump may run again but he wont win another national election he lost reelection before the events of jan 6 and as president his job approval never rose above 50 he may go on a revenge campaign tour or run as a thirdparty candidate but all he will accomplish is to divide the centerright and elect democrats the gops defeats in the two jan 5 georgia senate races proved that the country is moving past the trump presidency and the gop will remain in the wilderness until it does too

does the board still maintain this stance will the board reject him as forcefully or will they treat him as a viable candidate in a regular every4year horse race

it seems as though if biden wins pennsylvania as he probably will biden needs only one more state to cross 270

also from the baby boomer death clock the analysis shows that since november 2020 to 2024

 125 million fewer over age 59

 11300 gen zs turn 18 each day a net of 16 million new eligible  young voters

while it may be a close race im hoping theres a low probability that trump will legitimately cross 270

how does this relate to your analysis

httpsincendarcombaby_boomer_deathclockphp
what are your feelings about how dems will try to appeal to the white vote in the midwest
frankly while i am curious how youll answer some of the inquiries about your companies behavior given previous statements by those who quit due to the murdoch takeover i am somewhat interested in the topic in general so  

 do you think there will be a recession before the election
 what do you believe is the most likely outcome vis a vis the election as far as the current slate of legal cases will any have resulted in a conviction before then
 do you think that theres a serious chance international affairs actually have an impact on the election if so where
 what do you expect is going to impact the election that isnt getting attention now
what is the best way for me to mitigate the amount of brain cancer i receive from the medias reporting of this upcoming election
is there a sense from the 2020 battleground states namely wisconsin arizona and pennsylvania that the voters were satisfied voting for biden or have the past four years changed that feeling and given an edge to trump for 2024 

also does the wsj do newsroom pizza on election night asking as a former reporter for a small city newspaper
how about the rise of rfk jr   is this the start of a phenomenon   

hes up to 22 in at least one respected poll
how much do you plan on reporting on rfk jr cornel well and whoever no labels backs
compared to the last election are there any states that are now more of a battleground than before where will we see the candidates focus the majority of their time
do you believe that the shifting of primary elections dates by the dnc to set south carolina as the first state was linked to jim clyburns endorsement of biden in 2020 if so would this point to undemocratic tampering of the 2024 democratic primary election for bidens benefit
do you think that biden giving isreal a blank check to commit genocide against gazens is a political decision to prevent the gop from saying biden is soft on terrotists
do you think haley would beat biden in a head to head 

will there be a rally round the flat effect on election day for biden  he is currently way below the level at which he beat trump
not hyperbole at all you stated facts
eric trump is literally testifying to being involved in massive property fraud on trumps behalf even this very hour

in no way should anyone related to this organization be anywhere near a position of fiscal and legal power it is beyond insane that this isnt being screamed at the rooftops by any organization with even the slightest bit of journalistic integrity

there isnt even a question of whether or not trumps org is guilty thats already been proven its now just a manner of how harsh the sentencing will be and the facts keep coming out and making them look just that much more corrupt and criminal

there is 0 valid reasons to trust trump in a position of power again 0 any reasons to do so are purely unethical dangerous and borderline self destructive

edit for those unaware httpstwittercomlawofrubystatus1720143884280320245
i think this is the main question this sub wants an answer to many of us asked it though you stated it more articulately 

the media in general treats it just as you said like any other election when the facts are that a legit christian nationalist is the speaker of the house roe has been overturned threats of violence and violence itself indeed are rising every day and openly fascistic politicians have all but taken over congress this is not politics as usual and its disingenuous as well as dangerous to pretend it is
yeah but joe biden stutters sometimes and he also tripped over a wire one time so obviously hes just as unfit for office s
the silence is deafening
thank you for asking this they say weve learned so much from trump about how awful and corrupt he is but legacy media continues to treat him as legitimate they report on fascism with kid gloves and open arms legacy media needs to do better
guess theyre chicken
i think you can find the answer in the first two words of that organizations name
apparently you can ask them anything but that
good question i think weve all learned a lot from our experience covering the last two campaigns and trumps time in the white house a lot of what he is proposing to do isnt new  either he proposed it before or he attempted to do it when he was in office so our coverage can be informed by what he actually did or tried to do and whether it succeeded heres a story we just did about his proposed secondterm agenda httpswwwwsjcompoliticselectionswhytrumpsdrasticplantoslashthegovernmentcouldsucceed6828ccbestmmso0k1xzbbix2zhttpswwwwsjcompoliticselectionswhytrumpsdrasticplantoslashthegovernmentcouldsucceed6828ccbestmmso0k1xzbbix2z

we also know how he reacted when he lost in 2020 and the false claims he made about election fraud and how his supporters responded to those claims so well have that experience to draw on if he does it again in 2024

 catherine lucey
yep  all media paraphrases what they believe a reasonable person in his position would be trying to say

reporting anything he says without a transcript provided is lying because any person who looks at the words he is actually saying can tell that he has no fucking clue what hes talking about no matter the subject  a monumentally stupid individual that is given a red carpet and the benefit of the doubt that hes trying to help the country hes fucking destroying

wall street journal opinion pages or not openly supports fascism

 ben pershing
yes   


jingles keys
that is one of the most important questions of the gop primary 

politically so far the prosecutions have only made trump stronger republicans  including trumps primary rivals  have echoed his argument that the cases are politically motivated an abuse of the system 

trump has a giant lead in polls and fundraising has soared he remains the clear favorite to win the nomination 

the big unknown is how some of the cases play out what if he is convicted in say the george election interference case or the similar one playing out in washington no one knows how that may affect the race

 is it relevant to spend money and time doing nation wide polls for president

yes we generally know that the national popular vote favors dems by about 23 points and so if biden is leading national polls by 4 or more that means hes likely to win the electoral college and if hes leading by less than 2 hes in trouble battleground states are correlated and so theres value both in looking at polls within a given battleground state and looking at national polls national polls also give us a much better sense of the overall us house environment where there are competitive districts in most states and not just the swing states

overall forecasting and interpreting election data is both an art and a science good forecasters will take a variety of data including national polls state level polls special election results incumbency advantages fundraising levels trend lines and other factors and use it to get a sense of where things may be headed in this regard more data is a good thing even though no single data point is anywhere close to conclusive
its definitely true that a relatively small number of swing states will decide the presidential election but we still see a lot of value in national polling which is why wsj will continue to invest in doing our own polls they help us get a sense of which issues voters care about nationwide and also to gauge energy and enthusiasm among different demographic groups and we care a lot about house and senate races as well many of which will take place in states that arent competitive in the presidential race  ben pershing
  
the 2024 presidential race could be reduced to  less than 15 of the us in 4 remaining competitive battleground states with as few as 43 electoral votes where virtually all attention will be focused  arizona georgia nevada and wisconsin
wsj spends a lot of time and effort making sure reporters are safe and prepared to deal with any threats and i know other news organizations are doing the same  ben pershing
some officials in states such as new hampshire have said they dont have legal power to remove a candidate from the ballot but courts in colorado and minnesota are considering claims that former president is disqualified from 2024 ballot because the constitution bars insurrectionists from office trumps legal team argues the disqualification claims which are being filed in more states are an antidemocratic attempt to prevent voters from deciding the next occupant of the white house the wsj published a story yesterday on that topic httpswwwwsjcompoliticselectionstrumpdisqualificationchallengesfacetestsintwostatesca7d9887stfz1om3qbe77uvklhttpswwwwsjcompoliticselectionstrumpdisqualificationchallengesfacetestsintwostatesca7d9887stfz1om3qbe77uvkl

there is a strict separation between our opinion and news sections so we have no idea what the editorial page will do and no influence on it and they have no influence on or knowledge of what we write  ben pershing
what are your feelings about how dems will try to appeal to the white vote in the midwest  
  
biden has put an emphasis on appealing to workingclass and union member voters and it was crucial to his narrow victory in battleground states in 2020 he has stressed policies to spur manufacturing jobs and recently joined the picket line with the united auto workers becoming the first us president to walk a picket line according to the white house and historians

 alex leary
of course there will be a recession between the media hyping a recession in a shelf fulfilling prophecy and big oil cranking the skullclamps on the economy by arbitrarily increasing fuel prices right before the election were going to be fighting a pretty big uphill battle
there have definitely been signs in polling of those swing states that people are unhappy with biden for a variety of reasons age the economy etc i wouldnt say trump has an edge though because most of the polls still show the race essentially tied

as for election night food weve ordered from a local mediterranean chain the last few cycles since people seem to want slightly healthier food that doesnt make them want to take a nap but then around midnight we all just start eating chips cookies and other junk 

 ben pershing
we have written several stories already on them as well as on the primary challenge of rep dean phillips to president biden here are some examples and you can expect more coverage as the contests progress

we expect many of the same battlegrounds in 2024 in particular michigan wisconsin pennsylvania arizona and georgia  all states trump won in 2016 and biden in 2020 other states that could be competitive include nevada new hampshire and north carolina  catherine lucey
the 2024 presidential race could be reduced to  less than 15 of the us in 4 remaining competitive battleground states with as few as 43 electoral votes where virtually all attention will be focused  arizona georgia nevada and wisconsin 

we need to support state legislators throughout the country who support the national popular vote bill    
it simply again changes state statutes using the same constitutional power for how existing state winnertakeall laws came into existence in 48 states in the first place   
maine in 1969 and nebraska in 1992 chose not to have winnertakeall laws   
the bill will guarantee the majority of electoral college votes and the presidency to the candidate who wins the most popular votes in the country   
the bill changes state statewide winnertakeall laws not mentioned in the us constitution but later enacted by 48 states without changing anything in the constitution using the builtin method that the constitution provides for states to make changes  
  
states are agreeing to award all their electoral college votes to the winner of the most popular votes from all 50 states and dc by simply replacing their states current district or statewide winnertakeall law   
  
states have the exclusive and plenary constitutional power to choose laws before voting begins for how to award electors  
  
the bill has been enacted by 17 small medium and large jurisdictions with 205 electoral votes   
when states with 270 electors combined enact the bill the candidate who wins the most national popular votes will be guaranteed to win the electoral college  
  
all votes would be valued equally as 1 vote in presidential elections no matter where voters live	  
candidates as in other elections would allocate their time money polling organizing and ad buys roughly in proportion to the population  
candidates would have to appeal to more americans throughout the country  
  
every vote everywhere would be politically relevant and equal in every presidential election  
no more distorting crude and divisive red and blue state maps of predictable outcomes that dont represent any minority party voters within each state  
no more handful of battleground states where the two major political parties happen to have similar levels of support where voters and policies are more important than those of the voters in 38 predictable winner states that have just been spectators and ignored after the conventions  
we can limit the outsized power and influence of a few battleground states in order to better serve our nation

biden certainly feels a lot of affection for south carolina because his victory there and clyburns endorsement really righted his campaign in 2020 and helped set him on the path to win and plenty of democrats have said over the years that new hampshire and iowa arent very diverse and not representative of the democratic electorate whereas south carolina has a lot of black voters on the other hand critics in the party note that if biden wanted to put a diverse state first he couldve chosen georgia which is also an important general election state and sc isnt 

ben pershing
nikki haley is rising in the gop primary polls though she is still far behind trump her supporters argue she would be a stronger general election candidate than trump given her foreign policy experience and lack of baggage but at this point it is not likely shell get the chance to face biden    catherine lucey
vivek ramaswamy on abc calling it a 1776 moment and a revolution and none of the anchors saying wtf
his dog bit an ss agent he should be in prison
dude has dementia straight up
unsurprisingly i got no response

i was trained in journalism its sadly typical back then we were trained to understand that media bias was typically created by selective reporting you report on news stories that are not necessarily wrong but confirm the bias of the audience to create an unspoken narrative i wrote a thesis on how this was done back all the way in 2007 and had already learned about the dangers of echo chambers online just a few years prior

however what few were prepared for was the outright acceleration in blatantly false propaganda outright spewing stuff thats unproven or even disproven deliberate disinfo everyone was taught not to do this but social media rewarded the grifts and lies and mainstream media followed it there because of echo chambers so here we are

trumps entire campaign and way of life relied on the latter while older conservative news used to rely primarily on the former ultimately i ended up working more in the fictional entertainment industry which was always my goal since i felt in the modern internet era emotionally relatable entertainment could be a more effective teacher gen y and z

but i still spend my time trying to report on facts and info where i can here and motivate action in the face of whats clearly blatant bad faithed manipulation in the online world and apathy from the forprofit presses

even if i cant get a response from traditional journalists for many reasons some may put their career at risk by even acknowledging my position i have to try to do what i can in websites like this often at the expense of my own time because free platforms get some of the widest reach and i prefer to stay somewhat anonymous

it is what it is
thats not a very satisfying answer would like to hear things like we wont cover the dramatic palace intrigue stories that distract us from the actual issues or were going to call his lies lies instead of tiptoeing around it with gentler words
you mention all weve learned a lot and then point to an article that is treating him like a legitimate presidential candidate again and not the serious threat to democracy that he is you say we learned a lot but just like trumps proposals legacy medias coverage of him isnt new
thats not the good answer that i think you believe it is i appreciate that you answered that commenters question but

thats not the good answer you may think it is
dang swing and a miss people are more afraid of being wrong again like they were in 2016 than we are of actually taking all the actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of that disappointment happening again

anytime anyone writes about trump it must be from the perspective that its a foregone conclusion he will lose and go to jail anything else only serves to prop him up as a viable candidate and that actually increases the chances of that happening

but what if he does escape justice again

if youre wrong and he escapes justice again then who cares at that point are you really going to be concerned about some egg on your face when democracy is done as we know it because the magas won no shit will be too late youll die feeling smug i guess haha we told you he could win again no better to take every single action you can now to ensure it doesnt happen

only writing about him as the loser he is and will continue to be along with deplatforming and overall writing less on him are the single best things you can do to positively influence the way this country goes in 2024

here are examples where you prop him up as a viable candidate or someone who will not face repercussions for his actions these only serve to move the needle closer towards what you are fearmongering about if he wins then we are all screwed anyway

if donald trump retakes the white house they might succeed

i would hope this is a seminal moment to crush the deep state and the administrative state that has operated with its own set of agendas for a long time said russell vought trumps former budget director vought now president of the conservative center for renewing america has helped craft recommendations for a possible second term 

cmon wapo not propagating through your platform the baseless fear mongering a trump staffer does is the least responsible you could be

trump could make progress on some of his proposals thanks in large part to the supreme court 

but if he wins in 2024 trump would find a friendlier court than the one that sometimes frustrated him

writet about him as if you are doing a history report from 10 years in the future one where he goes to jail 

or youre enabling his win in exchange for more clicksviews because people are addicted to fearmongering

 republicans  including trumps primary rivals  have echoed his argument that the cases are politically motivated an abuse of the system

isnt that your job to determine if the cases actually are politically motived and an abuse of the system and then report that with evidence to your readers rather than just repeating what politicians say
gop primary 

ok same question but election  its not insightful to point out that a mindless cult is more culty when under perceived attack  we know there is literally not one other person who could possibly win the primary unless they gop make him ineligible for nomination

the interesting question is how does it affect the general election
the 2024 presidential race could be reduced to  less than 15 of the us in 4 remaining competitive battleground states with as few as 43 electoral votes where virtually all attention will be focused  arizona georgia nevada and wisconsin 

because of statebystate winnertakeall laws not mentioned much less endorsed in the constitution     
	  
issues of importance to 38 nonbattleground states have been of so little interest to presidential candidates that they dont even bother to poll them individually   
  
in 2004 senior bush campaign strategist matthew dowd pointed out yesterday that the bush campaign hadnt taken a national poll in almost two years instead it has been polling the then 18 battleground states  
	  
bush white house press secretary ari fleischer acknowledging the reality that then more than 23rds of americans were ignored in the 2008 presidential campaign said in the washington post on june 21 2009   
if people dont like it they can move from a safe state to a swing state   
  
kellyanne conway trumps campaign manager in 2016 said  
when i took over as campaign manager in 2016 we did zerolet me repeat the numberzero national polls  
  
when and where voters are ignored then so are the issues they care about most   
  
the political reality is that campaign strategies in ordinary elections are based on trying to change a reasonably achievable small percentage of the votes1 2 or 3 the only 12 states that received any attention in the 2012 general election campaign for president were states where the outcome was between 45 and 51 republican  that is within 3 percentage points of romneys eventual nationwide percentage of 48
we can limit the outsized power and influence of a few battleground states in order to better serve our nation

we need to support state legislators throughout the country who support the national popular vote bill    
it simply again changes state statutes using the same constitutional power for how existing state winnertakeall laws came into existence in 48 states in the first place

candidates as in other elections would allocate their time money polling organizing and ad buys roughly in proportion to the population

trumps legal team argues the disqualification claims  are an antidemocratic attempt to prevent voters from deciding the next occupant of the white house  
the irony is crushing
the question asked for an opinion either individually or collectively you just responded with a summary of the issue and the linked article doesnt take a position either

dont do an ama if youre not going to address the question you receive
becoming the first us president to walk a picket line according to the white house and historians

it feels weird that you say it that way wouldnt the journalistic approach be to confirm whether he did or didnt and simply report that  


this is not meant as an attack i am genuinely curious as to the reason why it was reported as such
thank you
thank you they look good
way to respond to the tough questions
as for biden his campaign certainly hopesargues that democrats  even those who say now that hes too old and shouldnt run  will eventually come home and support him particularly if trump is the alernative  ben pershing
a 1776 moment ifwhen we defeat him and his ilk maybe

trump who defended january 6 rioters chants of hang mike pence now wants his former vps endorsementhttpswwwbusinessinsidercomtrumpcallspenceendorsedropping2024race202310  businessinsidercom","he will ultimately support the man who tried to have him executed
maga republicans hate him because he would not support trump attempting to steal the election
non  maga republicans hate him because he supported trump doing everything else
everyone else hates him because he is an empty suit
oh not so fast mike you have to carry your campaign to full term
it turns out that the folks who tried to hang you also wont vote for you

who could have guessed
does that mean mike pence is free to testify against his dear leader
this thread has more replies than people who planned to vote for pence
im honestly grateful he did his job on jan 6th but what ill remember most is him going to a colts game just to feign shock and disgust at some peaceful anthem protests leaving immediately after it was all a stunt as he still had things scheduled during the game and then of course trump took all the credit by saying he ordered pence to do it
he said going forward hes going to help elect principled republican leaders which might be difficult considering theres no such thing
think about it he was a far right evangelical christian conservative candidate as vp he did everything his base ever asked for 13 of scotus was decided under the administration he was part of in any other case he would be greatly heralded by the conservative electorate except he didnt  do anything illegal on jan 6 as much as he probably wanted to because of that he is demonized by the circles he was the biggest part of they all call him a traitor for doing his ceremonial job i would say its pathetic but its mostly just him reaping what he sowed congrats mike this is your party
he is saying the election was rigged but the constitution doesnt allow him to overturn the result no moral clarity no courage to call a traitor a traitor because he had ambitions of his own well no more
to be so seduced by power in running with trump to then fully supporting his every policy every tweet and ignore every value mike pence proclaims to stand for only to be thrown completely under the maga bus after jan 6th and then still having to say yes sir thanks for cutting my balls of sir what an utter spineless pos mike pence is
i am shocked that mike pence failed to win the support of the republican base who wanted to hang him from a gallows during the january 6 insurrection
i dont understand why he even had a campaign who actually donated to him thinking hed win

maga actively wanted to hang him hes not right wing enough for the crazies and too conservative to bring over moderates and undecided 

hes also got the personality of store brand white brand toasted on low
it was delusional of him to even run in the first place trumps cult hate him and he was never popular among other republicans either
i feel bad for his 12 supporters
mike pence makes jeb bush seem charismatic glad he did his constitutional duty on january 6th only after looking at every other potential option and has meekly condemned the growing fascism rising in the gop over the last decade but only because they supported someone else other than him he gets points for supporting ukraine and democracy relatively as a whole but mike pence is 110th of the candidateman john mccain or mitt romney were amazing that mike pence can only get 5 in todays republican party his legacy is january 6 and worst presidentvp relationship since the end years of the bushcheney administration in another universe him mcconnell and kevin mccarthy collective condemn trump and gets impeached but because of their short sighted cowardice they have all lost the reigns of their own party for the next few decades gop death spiral gonna death spiral and they 1000 deserve it we are all witnessing a relatively quick schisming or fractionalization of the republican party maga is essentially pushing out the influence of traditional defense and business community factions leaving maga and christian religious fundamentalists but if their own guy cant get more than 7 what does that say
can you suspend something if it never really started
pretty white for a fly guy
mother do you think theyll drop the bomb

mother do you think theyll like the song

mother do you think theyll try to break my balls

ooooh aah mother should i build a wall

mother should i run for president

mother should i trust the government

mother will they put me in the firing line

ooooh aah is it just a waste of time
in any other case mike pence would be a champion of the far right conservative movement except he did his ceremonial job on jan 6 

now he is a traitor the man who took part in choosing 13 of scotus is now demonized by his party 

congrats mike this is your creation
such a shame  i really thought he had a shot 
now lets see if he sucks more and endorses trump when he eventually gets the nomination
rip to mike pences fly

it certainly had more personality and flair for politics than pence could have
woah woah woah i thought pence hated abortions after 6 weeks
i cant even believe how much time and money this cowardly fraud wasted on this
i have also suspended my campaign to become president in 2024 

i also had as much chance of winning as he did
omg who will he endorse that lucky person if they can get all his supporters could move up to 3rd or 4th im just kidding it wont make any difference
you know who we should vote for instead of pence

the guy who is going to trial for trying to overthrow the government stealing and sharing top secret documents and trying to subvert the 2020 election  oh and he is a rapist and a con man who is losing his business license for fraud

thats our guy  he already lost once against biden what could go wrong

if the dnc cant beat trump in 2024 then wow holy shit  you dont get any easier competition than donny dementia who has a mugshot  the guy is a class a loser
its not as though he had any significant chance anyway 

being wishywashy about the former boss who probably tried to have you lynched doesnt make you a strong presidential candidate
sorry sir you shouldve made that decision weeks ago you must carry your bid to term now
everyone ever he had a campaign
this thread has more comments than pence had supporters
pence was such a lapdog i would cringe when he answered a question with under the guidance of president trump
i bet trump thinks he should hang in there
there needs to be an image collection of president hopefuls that updates with every dropout like there was 2020 with the dem primary but instead of a blue sky cloud background it should be fire brimstone and shit
has there ever been a weaker former vp candidate its supposed to be a huge advantage 

poor pence your god mustve been lying when he told you youd be president
he pulled out too soon

this suprised me even though we knew it would happen
pences trump endorsement in 32
ok that was always allowed
some are saying pence may be called as a witness in the federal trial of trump on the 2020 election charges 

do it mike maga already hates you and most voters dont agree with your views accept this and do whats right for your country instead of trying to prolong your political career
mother called him back inside
i guess mike pence trump tried to have me killed wasnt resonating the way hed hoped it would
mother im home
honestly the fact that he even tried to run just goes to show how completely out of touch he is and he doesnt even care his ego wouldnt allow him to see the forest beyond the trees and tbh i still dont think he cares it takes a special kind of narcissistic personality to have people literally roam through the halls of congress chanting for you to be hanged and to still think that those same constituents would vote for you honestly fascinating to me to see the complete denial of the reality before him it demonstrates a complete disconnect to reality and a complete disregard for acknowledging that possiblity
so it finally sunk in that the party that wanted to hang him might not want him to be their candidate
remember that pence spent 300k of taxpayer money flying to a colts game so he could walk out when players knelt during the anthem
i look forward to his endorsement of the man who tried to have him killed
mike pence is the dumbest politician ever by not helping to impeach trump he ended his own political career he was too cowardly to pick a side and thus was left with none
til mike pence was running for president in 2024
testify against trump defend the constitution
will he finally speak out forcefully against trump now or be a good little republican and fall in line
im surprised his utter lack of courage or charisma didnt attract a bigger following
mother must have told him to stop only plausible explanation
i dunno why he ever thought he had a chance republican voters literally tried to kill him
i forgot he was even running
nice i was correct on the who will drop out first poll  i might have a super powerlets see trump is going to prison
mother told him it was time to end his little campaign
does this mean he  mother have to go get a real job

oh wait social security
but the new republicans want that gone
fuck why did i take out a second mortgage and bet it all on mike pence im ruined
deleted
man to be a fly on his head for those conversations with mother
apparently more republicans would rather hang me than vote for me

mike pence
he was doing so well too
oh no so anyway
this helps desantis probably the most  yet desantis is worse than pence though pence would be pretty bad
if only he could have held on until iowa and learned in an indisputable way what a disaster this whole idea was
to be totally fair to pence i may never want him as president but ill always be grateful that he stood against a tyrant in the darkest hour
he was running for president til
his whole constituency wanted to kill him  i dont see how you come back from that

pence should vote for a democrat they dont want to kill him
never saw this one coming  lol

makes you wonder why he wasted his time and other peoples money to try anyhow
im sure having the personality of drying paint did him no favors
cable news i think the question on everyones mind right now is where is that 2 of gop primary voters going to go
wow this is really gonna shake things up
and the crowd goes mild
i wish i could be the flyhttpswwwcbsnewscomnewsflylandedpenceheadvpdebate on mike pences head when he tells mother he has dropped out of the race
and this announcement reminded me that he had a 2024 presidential campaign
mike pence is a chode that is all
im very surprised to learn he didnt immediately endorse trump the slim backbone he grew for the campaign has got to fall off at some point
its funny when a theocrat gets passed up by his base in favor of someone more evil
now he can spend more time with mother
the guy of hang mike pence fame
nothing of value was lost
forgot this fucking loser was running good riddance
aborted
its surprising to me that he couldnt have made it farther seeing as how he still had about 75k left in his campaign coffers the real question now is where will the 005 republicans who wanted him to win throw their support
oh well back home to mother
mike pence a man who was never in the military thinks _mulan_ is liberal propagandahttpswwwwrtvcomnewslocalnewspencein1999mulanisliberalpropaganda and argued that it shows why women shouldnt serve in the military
good riddance in one of the debates his proposed solution to gun violence was to expedite the death penalty oh how very christian of him
price is right losing horn
bye however i am curious why he decided to drop out before the primaries i thought most candidates wait to see how the first few primaries go before they call it quits
when reached for comment a spokesman  said he was going to hang it up
oh to be a fly on mikes head when that decision was made
how many days until he bends the knee and endorses the man who tried to have him murdered
it is time mike join us
the party wants him dead so he never had a chance
i forgot he was running
trump owns the gop and trump hates pence sell your party to a lying 3rd rate tv personality and this is what you get
suspend is an inappropriate word to use with mike pence
mike pence suspending his campaign reminds people he was actually running for president  
oh wow im sure the dozens of delusional republicans who wanted to vote for him are devastated
anyone bet on if he endorses his old boss
the noneless maga is cedingforced out of the party we all know this is coming but still pretty wild seeing it to start happening in real time 

will they just become maga retire or maybe coalesce in some other way
this just in ron puddin fingers desantis declares a resounding victory over mike pence 

tomorrow we take washington desantis told his supporters
thoughts and prayers
what happened did he shake too many hands and had to run and pray the gay away
watch this little wuss go endorse trump now
shockingly enough the party of hang mike pence fame was not on board with electing him
mother is going to be very upset
mother is very disappointed
good i will never forget the 180 he made after jan 6th 

i was no fan of guy but you do not do that to our vp period no matter who it is 

then him refusing to defend the officeposition by doing absolutely nothing about it and worked to help the people that came after him just made me sick
i doubt his 9 supporters will vote for anyone else
mike pence finally realizes what everyone else already knew
mother didnt like him shaking all those hands of temptuous female voters
i legit didnt even realize he was running
those ten old people who supported him are going to be sad to hear this
good riddance
every single gop primary candidate is running a vanity campaign probably hoping trump will give them cabinet positions
deleted
thank god  who did he think his voter base was  all he was doing is sucking up half a percentage point that could be going to nikki haley
fare thee well brave sir robin
he was never going to win and no way in hell would trump pick him as vp again
i wonder if that last stop at walgreenscvs did it in it seemed like most of the old people went there to take a nap
not sure what his play was to be honest 

the maga crowd and trump turned their backs on him trump would never select him again for a high level position he never had a chance to win the nomination
curious if this has anything to do with the flipping of lawyers or if its just a coincidence that he announced this just days later
so long mechanical pencil
trump will lock him up if he gets the chance to go full autocrat
i hate myself for this timeline i cannot stand mike pence his politics and his beliefs are abhorrent but the fact that he at least doesnt come off as a psychopath like most of the gop made him seem weirdly sane
never thought i would be sad to see someone who did the bare minimum of resisting a push to overthrow democracy leaving
mother will be disappointed
how can you tell
makes sense seems like nikki haley is really sucking all the financial wind from any republican that isnt trump kind of surprising as well though since he was the only candidate that seemed particularly religious
i forgot about him honestly
if a pence falls and no one notices does it make a sound
oh no

anyways
now of course it remains to be seen if he endorses  im betting that he will and that itll be nikki haley and that this will prompt the hutchinsontier moderates to drop out and coalesce behind her  

however i also expect that even in a head to head haleytrump primary matchup that trump would easily walk away with the nomination so its not like it matters much except for any future comeback attempts by pence
wow this is incredibly shocking did anyone even know he was running for president im shocked
mother will not be pleased
hes a man of misguided integrity who let himself be used by those who misuse integrity while hating those who have integrity manipulating himself using a mistranslation of a book which has mixed results in trying to capture integrity
but the fly is still running right
mike who
the fly had better poll ratings than him
oh no anyway
he was so close
he wasnt going to make the debate
cvs campaign circuit didnt work out
probably had something to do with his rally he hosted to 7 old tired guys a week ago
im not surprised he ran  whats surprising is people thinking yeah i should give this guy money because hes gonna win
good riddance   90 of american voters 
this is a weird way for me to learn that mike pence was running for president
mike who
now think about the money was was donated and spent needlessly on a campaign that literally everyone knew was pointless and affected nothing
wait i thought god had called on him to be president
oh well sucks to suck im not sure why anyone else is bothering to stay in the race  the gop is trumps party there is no way he isnt the nominee
jeb
he says its not his time what not old enough for a  gop nomination
no idea what he was thinking in the first place all he was doing was wasting donors money
im sure trump will be insufferable on his website
man was an embarrassment period
suspended probably because he slept with the teacher
he wishes it was 1950 again
so does it mean that the religious conservativeleaning voters who went for trump will now go to trump

sorry pence i forgot you had your mother
ha i just got his flyer on my door yesterday
all the shit sandwiches he took from trump were for naught  please dont try to be a leader again you hypocrite
obviously mother didnt like the status of the campaign
but hasnt pence said that god wants him to be president so mikey is god wrong or are you lying about knowing what god wants
the fly came back with a message
i feel bad for forehead fly
at least theres one less person in the debates who cant answer a single question now
i kinda sorta maybe condemn some of the people who tried to kill me on january 6th 2021

i now want to lead the people who tried to kill me on january 6th 2021

for some reason the people who tried to kill me on january 6th 2021 dont want me to be their leader

i dont know what to do anymore so im giving up

does anyone else hear a buzzing sound
feels like only yesterday that he agreed to become trumps vp because he was so unpopular in indiana that he was facing a questionable reelection

who could have guessed that hed never be a presidential frontrunner
its close enough to where we could call this a halloween miracle right
did the coward endorse trump
good riddance to the sanctimonious hypocritical dickhead
i wonder if he sits around the dinner table and is like yeah i can become president does he know he cant like ever  

 his confidence is crazy high for his talent
mother
finally
wait he was running
thats alright sancho panza is still gonna vote for don quixote
i predict whatever support that pence had 38 in national polls is going to swing first to christie who is polling at 31 and then when he drops out to haley who is currently at 80 this scenario would bring her to 149 which is ahead of where desantis is currently at 141
pence i am suspending my campaign


america 


the rest of the globe
his voting block of six family members must be devastated
ok
mike pence none the richer
hang it up mike pence
pretty clear that his entire reason for running was to raise his profile for a book launch

his book comes out in two weeks
probably broke
god told mike he was boring
back to mothers nipple
mother is not going to be pleased
the least surprising move other than him entering the ring
mother should i run for president

nah bruh
doug bernum and asa hutchison lasted longer than mike pence
thoughts  prayers
oh no but who will the base hang now
nowjust go away
tucking tail and running again i see
after much prayer and deliberation
       
        why didnt he just pray to win 
this is why i cannot see anyone wanting to be trumps vp  

you will get blamed unless you literally commit treason and go to jail for trump
how long until he endorses the person who tried to have him executed
the fly in his hair is still running howeverhttpsmediavanityfaircomphotos5f7f36926cac71ad7f787fd1masterw_2240c_limitmikepenceflyjpg
he was running
who
oh i had completely forgotten about him
please clap
mike pence was nothing more than the human equivalent of reagan flavored lacroix  same great racist greed you love but now with zero spine
lol lmao even
mother probably told him to do so
thoughts and prayers
suspends means he can still raise money and doesnt have to pay taxes or some such right
and nothing of value was lost
what no who could have seen this coming who i ask you
im glad michael picard trolled him right before he suspended it again this was gold my dude needs to get into a nikki haley event since mike pence is gone

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuefq_3eezhwhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuefq_3eezhw

he wouldnt have been able to do it now just in time lol
vile loser
i dont think most republicans will be disappointed  democrats certainly will not
never had a path forward zero the trumpists hate him for not supporting the coup the liberals hate him for supporting trump in all other ways for years those remaining know that the time for a candidate like him is long past
the crazy thing is he will still vote for him too
he was running
mother
can you keep them in the dark for life
can you hide them from the waiting world
oh mother
good next do vivak
guess he misheard gods voice this time
so its going to restart at some pointlol
ha now we just need every other gop ghoul to step down
good riddance to bad news
mother will not be pleased
so he gaspabortedgasp his campaign
what ill remember most about mike pence is the famous fkn fly
please clap
no one even cares enough to comment lol
he said its not his time apparently he learned that the 1800s have passed
the mo udall joke seems fitting  he went into a barbershop in new hampshire stuck out his hand to a waiting customer and said hi im morris udall and im running for president  the guy shook his hand and said yeah i know  we were just laughing about that this morning

i also remember udalls concession speech after losing a state primary during his campaign  the people have spoken the bastards

mo udall was by unanimous acclamation the funnies human to ever run for president  ok i know that bar is pretty low
im glad to see the great humiliation of pence hes human garbage but this also puts us small step closer to trumps second term in office
removed
nikki haley is going to pick up steam
from the telegraphs us editor tony diver

after much prayer and deliberation i have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today he said

we always knew this would be an uphill battle but i have no regrets

mr pences presidential campaign had struggled to make inroads with republican voters and saw him trailing behind mr trump nikki haley ron desantis and vivek ramaswamy

he has also faced difficulty securing donations for his campaign

dude has the charisma of a wet fart and the morals of atilla the hun
once the other nobody candidates drop off itll be interesting to see how polling vs trump goesor if theyll make the same mistake as 2016 and have vivek haley and ron all in at once to guarantee trump wins it
any comment from the fly that landed on his head

 
oh no anyway
pence tried to claim he was a moderate except he was literally the vp to trump and went along with everything trump did except at the very end of the presidency when he decided to not steal an election thats it i have no idea how he thought he was winning moderates wouldnt like how he was 999 trump and maga wouldnt like that he didnt try to give trump the election
oh well
he was still running
the headline popped up on the phones of every body at my work and a few people said they legit did not realize he was even running
well i bet there are a ton of terrorists aroused by his weakness
darn  mother must have finally got through to him
down goes goodman down goes goodman
dropped like a fly
so the clear gummy bear gave up
thoughts and prayers
like he had any chance of winning

the charlotte hornets have a better chance of sweeping the milwaukee bucks in the playoffs this year than pence did of winning the nomination
buh bye  


amazing that someone like this would bother  either so deluded to think they had an actual chance or theres some other benefit in it for them  aka money seems kind of humiliating to me maybe hes into that sort of thing
holy shit mike pence was running for president
mike pence will be endorsing the liminal trump is 321111
his 15 supporters are going to be heartbroken
100 says he had to meet with some female donor like a damn heiress or some shit who just hoovers cash to shitty gop candidates and instead he and mother just decided to go back into whatever american gothic knockoff painting he came to life out of 

that campaign photo at the pharmacy was priceless that one guy in the foreground looked like death warmed over
the fly is sad
like the man from glad stood a chance he has the personality of a corpse
what an odd place to announce such a thing
mike pence was running for president
he will go down as the most craven politician in the countrys history
please clap
why do they say suspend it means end its over
i feel like if this wasnt announced no one would notice
i dont care do you
vaxxed
pence has a humiliation kink
remember when the fly landed on his head
the only thing mike pence was useful for was talking shit to trump during a debate if there is one mike pence has no support from both sides did he seriously think he had any chance
but what about those thrilling motorcycle pictures
mike pence doesnt have the courage to continue his campaign
im shocked the hang mike pence party didnt support mike pence
shocker eyeroll
cant wait to see who he endorses
mike johnson took the creep spotlight from him seriously republicans are just embarrassing bye pence i hope
who
does he endorse biden or trump
mike who
imgavatar_exp102959650bravo
its because trump is gonna be the nominee can you believe were here again
rough that he hung in there that long and couldnt finish
mike pence stands in the corner facing the crack  howdy glad you all showed up
his top dollar donors got tired of throwing money away they will likely change to haley

pence now has the anti endorsement excluding trump  pence can now endorse someone to actually tank their numbers

but really pence doesnt have final say over who he endorses hes already sold his soul when the people who gave him money yank on his chain hell endorse who they say like a good boy

i dont think pence did well enough to get a gig on any news outlet he wont be trumps vp again and unlikely would accept the position from anyone else he definitely wouldnt downgrade to cabinet position

so it looks like pence is done for good in politics his life is going to be a cautionary tale for politicians for decades to come
wait

 mike pence was running for president

shit didnt notice

anybody think taylor swift gonna fly to germany next week
he just wants to be included as a part of the crowd yelling hang mike pence
i am by no means a perfect man but i will never be able to understand how spineless these republican politicians are 

democratic politicians can definitely be spineless too but these people are just the 96 chicago bulls of being okay with anything as long as it furthers their pursuit of power
he said hell only support principled republicans


i give him a week before hes backing trump despite him having zero principles
hes going to be so tired from being on his knees for trump
hang mike pence no everyone was just inviting you to chill and play halo hang mike pence
teabagged by trump 
no doubt hes a modern republican a modern republican knows they either fall in lockstep or get they get thrown out and that lockstep is right behind trump
thats not really fair 

i hate him because he legit wants to turn america into a theocracy
weird cause he did try to help trump take the election but only by the book version once it became clear that trump was basically planning a violent overthrow he said no
its ok mom wife will always support him
flies like him
i wish he was an empty suit  he has hideous ideas and did real damage to his constituents in indiana
its been 6 weeks lets make him look at how financially hes screwed himself with an ultra audit maybe we can make him go to syria or iran to terminate his candidacy hes got the funds after all
we know it would be unaffordable and against your will but thats what you signed up for when you put on a suit and stepped into politics
brilliant
this
you can forgive him for the misunderstanding between banning abortion domestic terrorism and anti vaccination the gop loves to make sure people suffer and die
i think thats why he dropped out he knows he wont stand a chance in the primary after he takes the stand
i hope so
also does that mean an attack on him by trump is witness intimidation and not a campaign attack
obviously you missed the photos of his half filled pharmacy waiting area campaign stop last week there were at least 8 people there his campaign was picking up steam
i was within the margin of error to beat him
thats what i remember most after j6 performing for the stupid
worth noting that he tried to find an excuse to go along with the j6 plan and only after being repeatedly told that it was blatantly illegal did he decide to do the right thing
ill remember not masking up in a hospital during the height of covid
did similar with hamilton
he flew there too right what a waste of resources
hed vote for trump again is what he means
principled republicans leaders is an oxymoron
 he didnt do anything illegal on jan 6 as much as he probably wanted to

it will never not be weird that dan fucking quayle had to step in to tell him he couldnt just overturn an election like that this is a strange and ugly timeline
this is either him 

 committing to the new gop
 trying to remain comfortably neutral to both the maga and nonmaga repubs
 or him doing the only right thing by helping to hold trump accountable and therefore maybe saving the party while preserving his legacy somewhat
httpswwwbusinessinsidercommikepenceswiferefusedtokisshimontrumpelectionnight20189httpswwwbusinessinsidercommikepenceswiferefusedtokisshimontrumpelectionnight20189

this whole article is just amazing to read but the quote from karen pence in the first paragraph is just priceless  she saw this shitstorm coming from a mile away
theres probably some bible story about this situation i dont know it and neither does mike pence probably
it was basically a book promotion tour
i think youre giving him too much credit in that last sentence
the gop got pence on the ticket by promising him he would be trumps successor  but something changed and the establishment allowed trump to serve out a full term despite being utterly fed up with him

pence was supposed to be the savior of the party after the amorality of trump

the establishment underestimated trumps demagoguery made full use of it and are now screwed because of it there can be no successor to trump

plus along the way some establishment people surely noticed that pence has the personality of baptismal font hot dog water
hes plenty right wing the republican party isnt right wing anymore though that would imply they have any beliefs beyond whatever dear leader wants dear leader gets
this is exactly it nobody but his family was voting for him
mother will be devastated
they deserve it but we dont deserve the inevitable fallout as they thrash about in failure
suspend mike pence oh wait
give it to me baby

buzz buzz buzz buzz
that flew over a nest of cuckoos  i got the offspring reference  but i had to  seriously  the man is both straight up evil and completely devoid of personality  

now  give it to me baby
hush now baby dont you cry  
mamas gonna make all of your  
nightmares come true  
mamas gonna put all of her fears into you  
mamas gonna keep you right here  
under her wing  
she wont let you fly but she might let you sing  
mama will keep baby cosy and warm  
ooooh babe ooooh babe ooooh babe  
of course mamas gonna help build the wall

httpsyoutubexe3nukcnzp4siyqugu1t05fzalinq
i feel bad for the fly he was sorta carrying pences popularity this whole time whats he supposed to do now
hes going to swallow the whole load
that made me chortle   thank you
basically retired and wasted his donors money but yeah time wasted
he was only doing it to be kingmaker and still vastly overestimated his sway in the party
this is part of our issues as a country  we cant agree on raising minimum wage  yet this idiot spends millions on a losing campaign  yet nothing will be said about it but on here
and you didnt have to spend any money
hes going to endorse trump of course
he already lost once against biden what could go wrong

half of america could stay home and not vote and allow the country to slip into fascism without even a whimper of protest 
he didnt lose biden stole the election from him so the guy got suckered by biden thats the guy who should have the job hes not a loser hes just a sucker 

but yeah the dissonance is astounding
surprised he even ran honestly

its almost like he forgot which party brought gallows to hang him on jan 6th
under his eyeesque
or his near constant chucklefuck defense oh trump never said that interviewer rolls tape of trump in fact saying it well what me meant in his heart
i think the existing meme format is fine  its laudatory if meant sincerely derisive if contextually posted insincerely
not yet he wont do that until after the primaries if at all
hes the most cucked politician in the country itd be hilarious if the other republicans werent actively turning 40 of the country into christofascists
pence was an exception to the witness intimidation gag order because he was running for office that exception no longer exists any attacks on pence are now sanctionable
fake noose
impeachment happens in the house pence was pretty much just the tie breaker in the senate but actually a part of the executive branch as vp
whatever mother tells him to do
we already know the answer
he sized up how the speaker placement went and noped the fuck out
your username is my lifes motto lets rock
shucks ma the street lights arent even on yet
if it aint the most cowardly possible option it aint pence
im sure all 7 of his supporters are dissapointed
barbie boots gets his half a percent or whatever
the fact that pence is one of the more reasonable candidates really says alot about how far the gop has fallen and the level of batshit crazy people who have taken it over
i mean hell probably get almost as many primary votes either way
yes exactly 

i wish he was never in office hes most certainly brought more religious nonsense into our lives 

but the fact that he did the right thing at the right time deserves to be recognized i dont want him in office ever again but imagine if he had gone up to the podium on jan 6 and just said i refuse to count the votes because they are illegitimate 

who knows what would have happened on that fucked up timeline
except his argument was that he didnt have the authority and was always ambiguous about the results of the election he didnt say he believed the election was fair he said he didnt believe he had the constitutional authority to do what trump wanted him to do good riddance
you mean doing a basic ceremonial duty make no mistake he really wanted to overturn the election he just didnt wanna go to jail
he was actually still running away from the rabid trump insurrectionists but who can tell the difference
to whoever gets the nomination so trump theyll waffle about with platitudes but then make some asinine excuses about something like concern over  taxes the border the economy or bidens age before going in and voting for trump because deep down they will always vote for the r candidate because theyre just shitty people
his only claim to fame was that he had done the right thing on jan 6th now a decent  of republicans likely agree with that statement but hes still in a very odd spot where hes claiming accomplishments via trump and trying to distance himself from the attempted treason many trump supporters are also openly hostile to him for that same event   


he doesnt really gain anything from endorsing trump and he could throw his weight to any of the not quite trump candidates as the field thins   


genuinely curious what his goals were when running initially seemed unlikely to thread the needle and im not sure whod support or benefit from him except maybe hardline religious right types
now that his political ambitions are over he seems more likely to be critical  like the republican congresspeople during trumps term eg sen jeff flake who had nothing bad to say about him until the moment they made the decision not run again  then the cowards would start revealing their actual opinions
mother has to provide permission for all endorsements
and the fly
no no  they were saying hey nice pants
also thats just such a useless idea most mass shooters go in with the intention to die so the death penalty would do literally nothing to discourage them
however i am curious why he decided to drop out before the primaries

mother would no longer allow it
he cant afford to continue if he cant raise money theres not much reason to think that hell be able to get anyone to vote for him and without donations hes left with a choice between dropping out and funding his own losing campaign
he cant afford to keep going or maybe he didnt financially qualify for the next debate
have they tried to reach the fly for a comment
i hope he isnt roped in by trump
jeb
i forgot he was running
ill take the bet against actually because pence can afford to wait until trump is dead or otherwise irrelevant before he runs again nationally  endorsing trump this cycle would be a move motivated by very short term thinking
each will make up their own mind but unless you count lincoln projectliz cheney style sniping from the sidelines their options are limited to the first two

the organisations that make up the  democratic base have made it clear through action that theyre likely to primary anyone who flips to blue at the national level and third party candidacies are a road to nowhere these scenarios played out early in the trump era so those boundaries are well defined

that means you either go full maga or you retire theres no viable door number three that gets you reelected
the last time his supporter base tried to take washington that didnt go so well
hes either going to endorse trump or testify against him or both
mother said it was getting in the way of brushing her hair on wednesday nights
the only way mike pence was honestly running for president would have been if he denounced donald trump and for some reason he never is going to do that
some of them are definitely angling for 28 like vivek
evangelical white voters since thats why manafort had trump add him to his ticket in 2016 but these days trumps their guy outright
and it opens up a tiny trickle of donor funds for yet more haley ads during patriots football games
when danger reared its ugly head he bravely turned his tail and fled
very tough to determine who trump would pick as a vp my strongest guess is cruz
my bet is no one hell just run by himself and if he wins say that he doesnt need one
each one of these whale carcasses supports a whole ecosystem of lampreys and scavengers who rely on the candidate believing that america demands nay cries out for them
probably has more to do with running out of campaign money and low polling numbers
he is one of the biggest trumpenablers of them all

his only contribution to the world is that he allowed himself to be talked out of committing a coup

thats the whole list
like the new speaker pence just has that soft easy going plastic exterior that hides the religious ideologue  fascist election denier interior
pence should be everything that republicansevangelicals want a devout christian a family man and a true conservative but they hate him it shows how little their values actually mean
its because donald trump brought in a level of insanity that most of us have never really encountered  if anyone acted like donald trump to my face i would literally run away because they would be a crazy homeless person  

there exists sanity while having crazy beliefs i think thats actually pretty normal for humans as a whole  we all have crazy beliefsideasunderstsands about something in our life its just that for most of us it might be within a hobby like you swear by a certain kind of fishing lure and literally wont use anything else for tuna in situation x you could be a star wars nerd talking about the history of tattooine being a water planet and the atmospheric water being harvested was actually sold across the galaxy at a supreme markup because of its purity

i dont think someone like mike should actually be in politics i dont even like the idea of him having a platform to talk about politics but where he belonged was really as a conservative radio host  hes mild mannered knows how to respect people in general could carry on a normal conversation about a mutual interest like say he likes architecture you could probably have a pretty normalinformed conversation about that with him 

with trump you couldnt do that about anything  thats a level of insanity most of us dont actually understand and not only that that is the level of insanity that is leading a large political movement in the us
he did come off as a psychopath just not on that one issue
does that mean he isnt coming on
i believe that both sc candidates beat trump head to head trump has a solid hold on 2530 of the gop voters but the rest dont like him much the gopd best shot is to get it down to two candidates asap
he can now fully throw his support behind the man who encouraged his followers to eliminate him
those debates are pointless anyhow  every single time they have one it only results in trump who refuses to show receiving more support in the polls
he was in all the televised debates so it was pretty public
mike jones
grifters gonna grift
turned out it was the wrong god anansi north african spider trickster god was the one who asked him to run he thought it would be funny
trumps arterial blockages may say otherwise
they are running for second in case he dies before the election whoever comes in second in the primary will be in a strong position to take over the party when trump dies some of them may also be hoping for vp but i doubt he picks any of them
please clap
still hoping punished jeb enters the race and destroys trump would be hilarious
that gets you elected president in france
i sense causation  plz update us with future flyers you receive
great response
haha i have a t shirt of the fly on mike pences head holding a biden harris sign
from the bbc article

 in his resignation mr pence did not endorse any other republican candidates for the presidential election
hes from a different era he has swagger from prior time where his shtick worked well but in todays world he comes off like a half baked ai robot
five at this time  mother is withholding her endorsement until pence finishes his chores and moisturizes her toe calluses like he knows hes supposed to
he knows god likes him but like not like likes him
we can have a little roflcopter as a treat
he thought walking fast counted
probably not  hes suspending it so that he can keep collecting other peoples money
thats fucking hilarious
it literally changes nothing
i disagree the more people drop out the more the nontrump vote can consolidate doubt theyll ever get to 50 though
pence never had a chance and was never a challenger
zero is a number of principles to have
nonsense trump has many principals 
 never pay a debt 
 lie always
 a persons worth is directly proportional to their most recent comments about me

edit yes i meant principles
even if he never supports trump hell never do the actual principled thing support biden

its why w bush and mccain dont get credit for washing their hands of things you dont like trump great endorse clinton
haha correct have 0 principles is still having a measurable amount of principles
hows he going to find a principled republican asking for a friend
mother got him extra padded knee pads
a mans gotta work for a living
theyre not booing you mr burns theyre saying boourns  waylon smithers
yeah thats what my thought as well  for all the nothing about him the only something is that he would happily rule the country from a pulpit

i mean thanks man for sticking to the constitution when you had the job but no thanks
he had an actual failed coup i dont know why this is even up for discussion at this point its insane to me
even then im not convinced that he wouldnt have gone along with a violent overthrow if he hadnt literally been placed on the chopping block
mom wife teacher that he slept with
mike wanted the fun of running for potus but now that its time to take responsibility hes trying to take the easy way out its a real shame
its much too late to pull out this early
is he likely to be asked to take the stand in which case 
are you kidding a vice president polling at like 12 doesnt stand a chance no matter what he does
hopefully although its just as likely hell support him just to help ensure the gop wins anything for the party i guess
he dropped out because he hasnt qualified for the 3rd debate
ill remember the fly and how he sat still like a corpse during the debate
 told that it was blatantly illegal 

by none other than dan quayle
wasnt this when he was just vpelect and the cast said some inspiring words for him and he darted out like they pulled a gun in him
exactly he was hitting the books on any loophole he could do to overturn the election without jail time
fun dan quaylemike pence connection

they both served one term and moved to carmel indiana  where they are represented in state legislature by a gay democrat 

sometimes karma has a sense of humor
deleted
i guess in the future presidential candidates should avoid choosing a running mate from indiana if they dont want to be a oneterm president
mother do think shes good enough for me

mother do think shes dangerous to me

mother will she tear your little boy apart

oooh aah mother will she break my heart

hush now baby baby dont you cry

mamas gonna check out all your girl friends for you

mama wont let anyone dirty get through

mamas gonna wait up till you get in

mama will always find out where youve been

mammas gonna keep baby healthy and clean
im not gay  i just like the feel of dick in my mouth
given how badly trump lost the popular vote both times i really dont see it 

but the dems could campaign in the wrong states and get screwed by the ec again gotta avoid reaching 2016clintonsupporter levels of arrogance
real news fake tan real criminal real sedition
sorry for my sloppy verbiage but pence could have supported the removal of trump from office when he was being tried in the senate
i dont really care what the man thinks we wouldnt agree with each other anyways i just appreciate that he refused to play along when everyone around him was pressuring him
it is difficult to do when everyone else around you has gone insane you can be petty and not appreciate the stand or just be glad he didnt play along and potentially let congress throw us into chaos
they floated him a proposal but the fly thought it stunk
please clap
i forgot he was runnin
i could also see haley just for her popularity
by dan quayle of all people
you look horrified mother  rest assured he was saying hang with mike pence
back then they didnt want me
jeb kept you waiting huh
the best kind of correct
nonsense trump has many principals

not sure if this spelling error was on purpose or not but it makes the comment way more meaningful than if you had said principles
the question is are those republican principals  yes they are
i dont even know if he deserves a thanks for choosing not to install a dictator thats pretty 101 stuff

thats like a wife thanking her husband for not beating her its kinda the bare minimum you gotta do as a husband and you shouldnt have to be thanked for it ya know
he had to seek consultation from dan quayle to make a decision
mike pence is a pos that is guaranteed but hes boy scout in that he will do everything possible within the legal framework thats why he didnt get into the car and why he officiated the election votes in the end per his constitutional responsibility
wait his teacher
he cant refuse if the prosecutor subpoenaes him most likely in the fake electors plothttpsenwikipediaorgwikitrump_fake_electors_plot

the january 6 committee disclosed during a june 2022 hearing that sean riley a top aide to senator ron johnson attempted to submit fraudulent elector certificates through a top pence aide minutes before the vice president was to certify the election results but was rebuffed
hes not he was not in the room for any of the conspiracy they tried to manipulate him but he wasnt part of the big lie
omg the fly
that curious moment where dan quayle saves the republic

not coop coup
coup thats terrible dont do that
never would have i imagined dan quayle would save democracy in 2020
potato potatoe
right the original yes man saved the day with reason
thank god for dan quayle are five words that i never thought id use in combination but here we are
he was laughed out of politics for misspelling potato then we got progressively dumber and more popular republicans in w and palin before inevitably ending up with absolute morons like trump mtg and boebert the three of whom would struggle to spell potato even working together
the national popular vote is meaningless he only lost by 110000 votes in the key swing states
couldnt have really done that either his words would have meant just a shade above nothing

he had one shot to take a stand he could have invoked the 25th amendment on january 6th its hard to say whether it would have been successful devos and chao would have voted yes and so would wolff but its up for debate whether he had a vote pompeo would have been a no same with rosen if he got a vote 

but without pence that was doa from the beginning
she would accept and flip her switch right back to djt bootlicker mode
lol really i never heard that
i was saying boourns
thats been my problem with the medias portrayal of pence since january 6th hes not a hero after losing the 2020 election he was out there giving life to the big lie they all still excuse their behavior with bullshit about well there were irregularities we were just asking questions it was the presidents right to do so bullshit things went too far and theyre just trying to paint themselves in the most favorable light
exactly this people give this guy way too much credit the bar is pretty low when you got to thank someone for actually doing the bare minimum at his job not installing a wannabe dictator is pretty much a given and an absolutely basic duty 

this man believes this country should be ruled by a theocracy and a bully pulpit him dropping out is the best thing for this country and he is a absolute weasel

thats why he didnt get into the car

he didnt get into the car because it was agents he didnt recognize and suspected they werent about to take him some place safe it was 100 his self preservation instincts taking over
whoah no 

that would be weird pences bedmate is just a teacher

now newt gingrich theres a fellow who married his hs geometry teacher but dumped her later when she failed to maintain his high standards of beauty
say what you will about mike pence but he at least did the bare minimum to save democracy when a lot of other people didnt still an asshole though
he was definitely directly asked to participate in the steal he actively sought advice from former vps as he was deciding if or not he would go along with the plan before deciding he wouldnt it would not be out of line for him to be called to testify hes tried to dodge subpoenas before by claiming executive privilege im sure hell try it again
refresh my memory

did it crawl into his mouth a la belloq in raiders of the lost ark
it had its own twitter handle before the debate was over
i feel like if a guy that punches you repeatedly in the stomach daily for four years and then toward the end hands you a stale cookie giving him credit for the cookie is fairly unwarranted
depends on how you interpret his comments in that moment of refusing to get into the limo  the argument could be made that he was only worried about himself and not the fate of our country
 sought advice from former vps

now i cant stop picturing him calling joe biden to ask his advice
thats a good point"

edit thank you everyone for a wonderful conversation about early voting on vote early day we will try to swing back to answer any additional questions later tonight please cast your ballot today if you have an election in your community","how much engagement are you seeing from younger voters specifically gen z and millennials they could control the direction of the country if they showed up en masse to vote but typically fewer young people vote  however issues that are important to younger voters like prochoice and climate change are in the spotlight and the two parties have very different stances will these issues or others bring more younger voters to the polls
who comprises the demographic right now thats hardest to engage politically
hi bryce

ive done some canvassing and talking to voters in the past one of the hardest conversations ive had is around nontraditional voting ie early voting and voting by mail what kind of rhetoric or language can i use to help people expand their understanding for how to vote
what can i do to get political candidates from other states that i am legally unable to vote for to send me more texts
can you speak on states or districts that need some extra help to overcome gerrymandering  as well as the best ways to make it happen
ive been a poll clerk for a couple of cycles and we often see on day of voting people confused about their precinct  many people who need a change of address or same day registration could you talk a little about how voting early helps address any or all of the above
in my state we have over a month to vote before the last day of voting 

what are your thoughts on how extended an early voting period can or should be is there an upper limit and if so what sort of considerations should policymakers keep in mind when setting the length of an early voting period
deleted
true or false as soon as i actually vote the amount of political mail i get goes down
 absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud   jimmy carter

why not vote in person with a picture id
what is most exciting about this work and why
why are you insisting on voting early and how early voting effect voting process in positive ways
there should be a forced holiday to encourage people to take a day off to go vote supporters avoid all businesses on that day so that anyone remaining open is not overwhelmed
this is great thank you for your work  do you have connection with the nc dem chair anderson clayton  she seems like an amazing person doing great work to turn out more rural and other voters
httpswwwrealclearpoliticscomarticles20210708what_americans_lost_when_we_abandoned_the_secret_ballot_146050htmlhttpswwwrealclearpoliticscomarticles20210708what_americans_lost_when_we_abandoned_the_secret_ballot_146050html  


it is far too easy to learn how someone votes and to punish them  how does this effect our elections

 any of those votecounting workers or party officials may discover how you voted and give that information to those who will use it against you at work or at school possibly with the help of the highly partisan staff at big tech companies like google and facebook if you think nothing like that could happen  if you think that the laws that forbid that kind of thing are generally enforced  remember that we have seen people harmed by illegal or unethical releases of public records with the victims generally on the political side of jack ryan or joe the plumber and the perpetrators suffering no criminal or civil penalty
thank you very much for investing your time and energy this way cool to see people taking action about the places where they have passion

what inspired you to get behind this cause

what has been the measured impact on your efforts todo

what are your goals for the next 1510 years
how does your team feel about superdelegates
thanks  keep up your efforts to save our democracy unfortunately we cant get around the gerrymandering
some of the most actively engaged vote early day partners are campus groups today these groups are hosting events at their colleges tabling on campus and running outreach campaigns to make sure their classmates are casting their ballots each of these groups understands the power that young people can bring to the table when they share their voices which is why they work so hard on vote early day to get students to vote early
ultimately it comes down to representation and motivation there are a number of groups who do not vote at the percentage of the electorate they represent this is largely communities of color and young people other demographics ebb and flow from election to election but these two groups face some of the strongest hurdles we are grateful to work with vote early day partners who do important work in each of these communities to meet voters where they are with the information and encouragement they need to vote early  
on motivation  we have a larger issue with people opting out of politics because of the negative and often toxic nature of politics today no matter the demographic we hear from far too many people that politics seems like something they wouldnt want to touch with a 50foot stick thats a big reason why vote early day comes to this work with a spirit of celebration when vote early day partners build fun and exciting activations we are lowering the barrier to entry that keeps many people out of their democracy
great question vote early day was founded because voters often run into challenges when they wait until election day to cast a ballot long lines busy schedules lastminute problems or voter disinformation can stop people from having a chance to share their voices when you vote early you can make a plan to vote at a time that is convenient to you
more texts now thats a new one
gerrymandered districts are heavily tilted to one political party or another by those who create the maps voting early or on election day will not change the demographics of who composes the electorate but it can ensure people have an accessible way to share their voice when people vote early they can overcome other barriers like long lines voter disinformation changing elections and other hurdles that can stand in the way
thank you for the work you do as a poll clerk our democracy is only possible because of people like you who step up to serve  
voting early can play an essential role in combatting the issue you mentioned election day is generally the busiest day of the year for election offices so when you wait to vote until that day you will likely have to wait longer for the information you need when you vote early by mail you dont have to worry about finding the right precinct because they will mail the correct ballot directly to your house if you are voting early in person you can take the time to find the right location and go at a time that is convenient to you generally there will be minimal lines or none at all
the team behind vote early day arent policy advocates we are just early voting enthusiasts we are grateful for the opportunities each state provides to vote early either by mail or in person wherever early voting opportunities exist we have seen higher turnout and more people choosing to cast their ballot ahead of election day
we always recommend contacting election administrators in your state and local community to get the most accurate information regarding local questions about casting a ballot in kentucky you can reach the secretary of states office here httpswwwsoskygovelectionspageselectionscontactformaspx  
generally there is no requirement for voters to fill out every race on the ballot so you should not worry about your ballot being thrown out if you dont vote in every race
true campaigns know when a voter casts their ballot not who they voted for so once you have cast your ballot there is no more persuading to be done so youll get less mail phone calls and door knocks one more perk of voting early
voters concerned about our election systems integrity should take a tour of a local election office and hear about the diligent steps election administrators take to keep our elections fair and honest each mail ballot is scrutinized to ensure that the proper person has returned it through a signature verification process if you ask election administrators about the faith they have in mail ballots it is almost always very high  
if youd like to cast your ballot in person most states also have opportunities to do that early in most of those states youll be asked for an id ahead of being issued a ballot  
the behind vote early day does not take any stances on what policies a state should enact that is up to local elected officials we want to share facts that give people confidence in our systems that keep our democracy strong
without a doubt its getting to work with amazing partners who care deeply about empowering voters this year over 1600 national and local partners are celebrating vote early day their work will ensure millions of americans learn about how when and where they can cast their ballot ahead of election day none of this civic holidays impact would be possible without partners stepping up and doing the work to connect with people where they are
when people wait until election day things like long lines lastminute problems voter disinformation and confusion around constantly changing election laws can stop us from sharing our voices when you vote early nothing can stop you from being heard   
another benefit for the voting process comes from the benefits to election administrators when people vote early the demands on them on election day are diminished and the lines are smaller thats a big reason why election leaders of both parties love when people vote early
vote early day works with businesses to help adopt time off to vote programs one of the leaders in this work is time to vote which includes over 2000 businesses that commit to giving their employees time off to vote you can learn more about their work here httpswwwmaketimetovoteorg
vote early day is a nonpartisan civic holiday so we do not work with political candidates or parties we are excited for anyone encouraging americans to vote early
understood  thanks for the response and the work you do

its really funny i havent changed my political stance at all in the past 10 years yet somehow ive gone from an independent to democrat to far left democrat all without changing my political stance one iota   


i hate modern maga politics its a poison in america
mike johnsons positions

 supports a nationwide ban on abortion
 doesnt believe in climate change
 seemingly supports conversion therapy
 is against cannabis
 supported trumps muslim ban
 voted to eliminate funding for immigration and refugee assistance
 served on trumps legal team during both trumps impeachment trials
 signed an amicus brief in support of texas v pennsylvania which challenged election results
 voted to overturn the 2020 election in pennsylvania
 is against samesex marriage
 supports prayer in schools
ken i cant vote for an election denier buck votes for an election denier
republicans we are the party of law and order

also republicans but if you are not a traitor to the us constitution then you cant even think about being speaker
johnson is basically jim jordan without the name recognition and baggage
i love it nominating mike johnson is an acknowledgment by the gop that they cant govern without trumps approval effectively making him the shadow government they so often prop up as a boogeyman

it also means they have zero fucking chance of holding that party together once the convictions for trump come through and he loses the 2024 election by a wider margin than he lost in 2020

i still dont think hes going to actually get the votes needed because at this point the entire party is in passiveaggressive retaliation mode so everyone wants to act as spoiler for everyone else  safe money is still on us defaulting due to not having a speaker primarily and due to gop ratfuckery secondarily in backing out of an agreedupon budget deal
the dem yelled happy anniversary to my wife because shes a lesbian and johnson is against gay marriage
meanwhile over on conservative their biggest issue today is a partnership between ufc and bud light
silver lining 

the message is clear the republican party no longer has any moderates left they just chose someone who believes in forced birth with no exceptions someone who tried to overturn the election and end our democracy not only that but was a leader in those efforts thats who they want to be the head of all of them and to be 2nd in line to the presidency 

johnson is against interracial marriage joining 36 republican members to vote against protecting it

he is fiercely anti lgbt and a proponent of gay conversion therapy when he chaired the republican study committee he petitioned amazon to add books back to their market place such as healing homosexuality and a parents guide to preventing homosexuality after amazon had removed them

every gop house member in a biden district just lost 

he won 100 of the gops votes and now they for them gleefully support his views he is extremely far right and the magas have gotten what they want they own the gop now

they have tripled down on extremism lets see how it goes for them in 15 months jeffries will be speaker

edited
as a reasonably informed international observer i thought id give you all my responses to each stage of the gops infighting over this i hope that this indepth analysis from an outsider is useful

steve scalise is the new republican nominee for speaker

i dont know who the fuck that is

steve scalise once called himself david duke without the baggage

jesus fucking christ

jim jordan is the new republican nominee for speaker

i wish i didnt know who the fuck that was

jim jordan is losing more votes every ballot

yes hahaha yes

tom emmer is the new republican nominee for speaker

i dont know who the fu

tom emmer has withdrawn from the race

ohhh he was the disposable comic relief character i assumed thats what the dude in the bowtie was for

mike johnson is the new republican nominee for speaker

i dont know who the fuck that is
good afternoon all 

the fact that johnson voted to overturn  the 2020 election is all i need to know about his total lack of integrity  character

the republican party is broke as fuck
have the maga republicans seen this yet

httpstwittercommeidastouchstatus1717007778009714717

were also gonna try to work with democrats

nancy pelosi and the democrats are not the enemy look nancy pelosi and i say this in town halls and when im in large republican groups they go awww  you know im in an r13 district as its rated but nancy pelosi on an individual basis is a very kind and generous person shes been great to me come on she is im sorry folks back home she is

my role as a conservative is not to launch grenades at the other side and regard them as an enemy she is my fellow american shes doing what she genuinely believes to be the right course
adam schiff showing how you deal with this

httpstwittercomrepadamschiffstatus1717209208930615605

 you might be googling who mike johnson is this morning

 let me make it simple

 johnson is a hardright protrump leading election denier in the house 

 sadly this is what passes for speaker material in the republican conference

it was always going to be a republican speaker he wont get anything done so electing a shit heel like johnson is a win for dems if they use it like schiff is doing
those biden districts are gonna flip to the dems faster than a trump coconspirator
a sage dem texts basically repubs are gonna elevate a speaker who tried to overthrow the election and backs an abortion ban  the two issues we won on in 2022

what are they thinking 

httpsxcomjmartstatus1717190622652604682s20

johnson also backs total abolition of social security medicare and medicaid
al green of texas just voted for speakerinwaiting hakeem jeffries which is probably an accurate prediction if you look ahead to january of 2025
angie craig dminn just voted by saying happy wedding anniversary to my wife  hakeem jeffries

mike johnson has been vocally opposed to gay marriage

httpstwittercomjakeshermanstatus1717228192446951655tqncfgf80df1jcho6agehtgs19
for democrats johnson is better than mccarthy for increasing their chances of winning the house back in 2024 

by some objective means johnson is a political novice hes not involved in conference leadership was always more of a back room guy and hes an at best modest fundraiser 

republicans basically nominated a middle manager to a c suite position where theres a higher chance he can embarrass the party with his inexperience
this is looking like a slam dunk

the entire republican contingent in the house of representatives is going elect a speaker of the house who voted to overturn the 2020 election
these for the republicmike johnson statements are so cringe do these guys think theyre in a star wars movie
just a reminder to anyone reading

the speaker of the house isnt the one who certifies the electoral vote count that role goes to the the president of the senatehttpsconstitutioncongressgovbrowsearticle2section1clause3 who presides over a joint session of both the house and the senate

the current president of the senate is vice president kamala harrishttpswwwsenategovsenatorsleadershiphtm while there are plenty of things to worry about in terms of johnson being speaker certification of the next election isnt one of them
for those wondering here are the fates of the last 5 republican speakers

newt gingrinch forced to resign by his colleagues after he was discovered to have had yet another sex scandal and an absolute slaughter in the 1998 midterms that saw democrats pick up 5 seats

dennis hastert a convicted felon and sex offender who raped teenage boys as a footnote he was not the original replacement for gingrich that was robert l livingston who resigned following disclosure by larry flynt that livingston was having his own extramarital affair

john boehner after facing his own similar rebellion from the tea party john basically said fuck you guys im going home

paul ryan see above announced he wasnt going to run for reelection in 2018 for the same reason

kevin mccarthy well you know

so mr mike johnsonhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwghrq3xzsc
rconservative thinks this sub is melting down over the selection like what were just rolling our eyes second verse same as the first if anything its good because the congress members who voted him in from purple districts are going to get fucked come election time
yay they settled on a election denying sedition plotting idiot from la republicans make idiocracy seem like a documentary
in case anyone missed it it sounded like a republican went damn right when johnson was called an architect of the efforts to overturn 2020 openly cheering httpstwittercomatruparstatus1717226281673048397
and in case anyone missed it heres a clip compilation of the time johnson said that roe v wade affected the economy by not having enough ablebodied workers httpstwittercomhousejudiciarystatus1717183190463336780
putting a political nobody with no legislative experience in one of the hardest jobs in the land with a razor thin margin  what could possibly go wrong
let this be a reminder to everyone johnson is fundamentally identical in terms of ideology to jordan which is why the farright supports him

the only reason over 20 moderate republicans voted against jordan was because of the name recognition as a farright rep and his less tactful way of getting votes and talking points across

they are betting on their voters being just uninformed enough that they can vote for someone identical but not as inyourface as jordan
rings bell

bring out your dead

rings bell
good on you aguilar call this fuck out for his election denialism which he refuses to answer questions about
the gop going 100 allin on denying the 2020 election 4 years later certainly is a bold electoral strategy cotton
i rarely outright rant here but honestly im so fucking angry this isnt anything but the completion of caving to terrorists were witnessing the last tiny bit of support for democracy collapse in the house gop and it fucking infuriates me a man whose very presence is an insult to this chamber might actually be elected speaker and why because even the gop members from purple districts didnt care enough even about their own seats to put up a fight

im too fucking angry to sit this through going to go have breakfast
so they managed to pick someone worse than mccarthy great
so hes basically mccarthy but without all of the experience and political connections great im sure thats going to go well
were all living the downfall of america thanks to rupert murdoch
heres the nyt articlehttpswwwnytimescom20221003uspoliticsrepublicanelectionobjectorshtml cheney has referenced in regards to johnson

he basically set forward the objection strategy for congress by contending the pandemic policies were unconstitutional giving several members a way to placate trump without specifically supporting his conspiracy theories

34ths of all objectors would eventually cite his language with their vote to overturn the election

he was also instrumental in pushing the ludicrous texas lawsuit

fun stuff
mike johnson is a wild card to me he voted lock step with the gop to overturn the election but two years ago while talking about what the gop should do when they retake the house he talked at length about how democrats are not the enemy and that nancy pelosi is a wonderful person that he has a good working relationship with i have no idea what to expect from him as speaker

httpstwittercompatriottakesstatus1717006145833804105
american people you know that all of your house speaker candidates
are traitors and election deniers so are you cool with that

republicans yes of course we are

american people why

republicans because they are going to hurt the right people

fin
mike johnson is jimothy jordan without the abrasive personality the moderates therefore feel safe in voting for him
im an independent

here are all my republican only viewpoints also democrats suck
its a damn freedom caucus coup how the hell are the moderates allowing this
the rs are  enthusiastically  voting for a guy they just heard of yesterday afternoon
so the moderates were totally fine with a farright extremist just not one thats considered a face of the farright because even their uninformed voters know who they are
im so sick of republicans doing everything in their power to destroy my future for their own personal gain i just want a good life
get ready for the rs to be so proud of themselves for doing the bare fucking minimum
republicans are disgusting how can they say for the republic and biden is shredding the constitution when theyre supporting an election denier and a president that tried to overthrow democracy lmfao fuck these clowns forever
everyone needs to get out an vote and vote in every election not just the big ones
biden admin is gonna eat this clown alive lol
well hopefully this shit show hands the house to the dems next year
we got one kinda good thing out of this  jim jordan got utterly embarrassed turns out being an asshole as your primary personality trait isnt popular even among a bunch of assholes
this dude is just as bad or worse than jordon
everybody needs to vote in every single race local state and national it does no good to have democrats at the helm but have factions of maga throughout the country its the only real path
if it wasnt this guy it was going to be someone just like him theyre all the same some a bit crazier than others but it doesnt matter if its johnson or boebert it just highlights how foolish the gop party is and how hard theyre going to lose come 2024 at least now that they finally voted in a speaker the house can get going on some actual work the rest of us should get going on donating doorknocking textbanking postcard writing etc for the democratic candidates in 2024 we need to come together and vote these clowns out the door
totally unsurprising that the republicans unite around an extremist  the next time anyone tries to point to or claim the existence of a moderate republican point to this  the purported adults in the party who care so so much about the election and totally dont think it was stolen unanimously backed this piece of shit  the trash who say oh we just have some differences but we opposed january 6th just unanimously voted in someone who agrees with january 6th  the republicans from a biden district who totally wont accept extremism unanimously voted for johnson  there is no meaningful separation from one end of the party to the other and every single person who runs as a republican or who votes republican wants the worst maga terroristic fantasies to come true the only difference is degrees of willingness to be fully open about their thoughts not about what they think and believe
look at all this hand shaking and patting themselves on the fucking back you motherfuckers didnt do anything
lol so he only won because he hasnt pissed anyone off yet now its just a ticking time bomb for the next motion to vacate
house democrats are bulking up on their knowledge of new republican house speaker mike johnson and theyre not liking what theyve foundhttpswwwaxioscom20231025mikejohnsonhousespeakerdemocratsjimjordan

what theyre saying the consensus among house democrats is that he is a more genial jim jordan and plays well with others on his side one house democrat told axios speaking on the condition of anonymity

 but johnson is a hardline right winger who is in favor of a national abortion ban and is going to steer the house to the far right the lawmaker said

 he is not part of the main stream political or legal thought rep steve cohen dtenn told axios truly an aberrant candidate for america but maybe not for a drowning republican conference searching for a lifesaver

the context johnson is a former chair of the conservative republican study committee and is wellliked across the gops ideological spectrum

 he likely gets there said one moderate house republican hes too likable even for this group the house republican conference to stab

zoom in some democrats spent the morning giving each other a crash course on johnson over text according to two democrats

 one lawmaker argued in the text chain that because johnson is less outwardly objectionable than someone like jim jordan it makes his prospective speakership even more menacing

 another described him as an aw shucks version of jim jordan

zoom in johnsons efforts to overturn the 2020 election as the architect of an amicus brief supporting the texas v pennsylvania lawsuit are of particular concern to some democrats

 mike johnson is jim jordan with a bar card said house oversight committee ranking member jamie raskin dmd a former jan 6 committee member

 having served on judiciary with him i will grant that he has better manners than jim jordan and matt gaetz but ive never seen him disagree with them on anything related to the defense of american constitutional democracy and freedom raskin said

 cohen who led the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution with johnson for six years said they never saw common ground on voting rights womens issues  lgbtqi issues or the legality of the 2020 election

yes but johnson on his fourth term in the house and unknown to many of his colleagues across the aisle may have the opportunity to reshape his image

 i have had very little interaction with johnson said one senior democrat so like many members i have little information upon which i could make a judgment

 a senior aide to a moderate democrat said of johnson simply who

what were watching in the end johnson will have to navigate the same dynamic that led to the ouster of former speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif

 any spending bill will need to be able to pass the democratcontrolled senate in order to become law and therefore johnson will have to work across the aisle or risk a government shutdown

 asked if johnson is the kind of guy who can cut a deal with democrats on spending one democrat said he needs to
greeeeat an extremist member of the far christian right as speaker  atheists lgbt folk and women hold on to your hat  

he opposes legal marijuana too  you would think conservative libertarians would have a problem with that
just skimming this guys wikipedia right now on top of everything else hes also against the endangered species act and he doesnt believe in climate change which is accelerating extinction and adds species to the endangered species list
so they elected a nutty  
shutdown it is in november then
this guy mike johnson is a lunatic but he has at least communicated with democrats youre seeing them try to smuggle this fascist in because well at least he isnt jim jordan this countrys federal government institutions are fucked
deleted
there basically was no world where the republicans nominate someone that isnt a disaster mccarthy also voted to overturn the election so basically status quo here 

jim jordan was especially annoying in the impeachment trials and looks sweaty so if we get a guy with all the same terrible views as those two but he didnt annoy me as much in the past and doesnt look stinkyok i guess
are any independent line callers actually independent or just republican nut jobs trying to sneak to the front of the caller line
another independent who thinks that johnson is going to be  awesome and fair and thinks that the the real events of jan 6th is being covered up
anytime anyone calls biden far left i just roll my eyes so hard
reps really booing when this dude brings up exactly what they said their required qualifications were to the press
two points related to peoples concerns about johnson

1 good luck finding a republican in the house who isnt an election denier mccarthy was deeply involved in trying to overthrow the government its highly unfortunate but hardly unfamiliar territory

2 if this guy wins hes just some ftier nobody biden schumer and jefferies will run circles around him hes likely to be even weaker than mccarthy and that really is saying something
this has been about who can appease donald trump  


republicans bowed their heads at this one cant even deny it
quite unfortunate that the moderate republicans were literally blocked from a floor vote twice and still caved
there are no moderate republicans end of
i dont understand why donald trump is the hill you are willing to die on it would be one thing if he were a winner but since 2016 republicans have lost every national elections even in 2022 where they won they significantly underperformed what usually happens in a midterm against the incumbent

it just makes no sense to me
i dont understand why so many rs would oppose jordan and then fall in line with johnson johnson seems pretty much the same as jordan maybe name id is the difference
i am just disgusted with republicans for picking a known election denier its just not right
i feel like a government shutdown is extremely likely with this guy as a fed employee that is essential i shall go cry and look for part time work
i dont really care that he wins but the undeserved back patting is going to be pretty god damn annoying 

congrats on getting the barest of minimums of shit together after 3 weeks well done
theyre elevating a hard right election denier who wants a nationwide abortion ban which dems won against in 2022 

gl to the republican party next election lol
so are republicans lining up behind this guy who is fundamentally the same ideologically as jordan hes just more of an unknown to most americans so they are hoping to get less backlash
its legitimately scary that the last democratic election was stolen and an illegitimate president sits in the white house is just another talking point for republicans now democracy is a founding pillar of the country but because they elected a manchild president who refused to think losing was possible theyre just going along with it because he had enough sway over their voters

they have nothing in terms of any proof whatsoever other than things that look suspicious when removed of explanation or context but theyre going along with it because trumps ego brought out the same ego in millions of other people and ive never lost in a fair competition is a sentiment that they not only share but will escalate to even the most important parts of society itself
johnson just passed the 220 mark ugh i really hope that ads keep playing about how johnson thinks of women as breeding factories for ablebodied workers and national abortion bans
dude is literally the same as jordan hes just more unknown to the average american the fact that the republicans who refused to vote for jordan but voted for johnson just proves that this was only about optics not because they dont agree with jordan
my favorite thing about mccarthy getting fucked over is that he worked so fucking hard and long to get to that position he raised so much money for the rnc and got fucking snubbed by his party for a nobody who barely has a political career if republicans want to keep fucking over their sources of party income and have no money because they spent it all on trumps legal im all for it
the gop continues to reward people who tried to end democracy and punish those who tried to uphold it
mtg is shouting at jeffries her parents taught her zero manners
am i overreacting to think this dude is actually a lot worse than mccarthy
tells the world  we are back in business

6 minutes later  recess
johnson its time for bipartisanship

stefanik just now we must stop biden and the left wing agenda
johnson becoming speaker is at least to me the definitive sign that the extremists have won the gops civil war man i fear for this country even more post2024
this is a bad day for america the result here is worse than mccarthy and equivalent to jordan the extreme wing of the gop has won there is a real chance of a shutdown 

the debt ceiling compromise included gop poison pills for a shut down intended to make it more painful for them we shall see if the democrats fold allowing them to dismantle many federally funded programs in order to keep parts of the government running or of the gop forces a shutdown when they dont
johnson is not different from gym jordan they both are election deniers and ultra right wingers why would the moderates vote for him
didnt ken buck say one of the reasons he was against jordan was because he was an election denier but mike johnson is fine
aguilar spitting fire and telling the truth pissing off the republicans while he does
when have moderates ever had a spine their vote for johnson means they support the denial of climate change the fascist attempts to destroy democracy and the denial of the equal rights of women to have e choices of their own bodies 

pay attention if you are in these moderates districts they can be beat
deleted
on the plus side the attack ads for all the biden districts filled by republicans are a lot easier to write  your rep doesnt believe in gay or interracial marriage
shoutout to the gop for finally being able to do the absolute minimum required by their collective chosen occupation
deleted
republicans johnson is amazing johnson is awesome

so why was he not picked at the very beginning
welp dems better also take the house in 2024 if biden wins because johnson is a rabid election denier who spearheaded the effort to nullify the results in 2020

republicans putting someone like that second in line to the presidency is just another example of their contempt for democracy
if they do manage to elect a speaker today the gop is going to step on their own collective dicks in the rush to congratulate themselves on how great they are at governing
biden ran circles around mccarthy an experienced politician when it came to negotiations johnson is going to get littleboyd by biden and team and before he realizes what he has conceded gaetz will have already placed a motion to vacate thus we continue
today we are electing a great man who i just read about on wikipedia this morning probably
trump really got the entire party terrified in the past few days this is incredible
the republican party has went full electiondenier maga

every single one of them  dont listen to their words watch their actions voting an electiondenier like mike johnson into office  should stain each an every one of them for their entire lives
something to remember even if when they elect johnson theyre basically back to where they were before mccarthy was ousted the new speaker will face exactly the same pressures and dynamics that mccarthy did and that made doing his job so unmanageable republicans may finally have decided to compromise on a speaker but they didnt suddenly all change their positions on policy theyll still be at complete loggerheads over actual legislation its still unclear whether they can actually pass any bills without democratic votes
this has to be one of the absolute dumbest courses of events to ever happen in the house
rs are so proud of themselves for doing the bare fucking minimum literal bottom of barrel minimum for their job
congrats to the rs for finally signing their name on the test back to the regularly scheduled shit show
is this guy as batshit as some of the other gop reps dont know much about him


edit was a sincere question didnt realize he was an election denier fuck this idiot
why is johnson better than mccarthy isnt he more extreme so the moderates lost this one
well republicans the easy part is over now try to pass literally anything
i continue to believe we are in dire need of a radical overhaul of our entire broken and unrepresentative system of government
sadly i think johnson has a much better shot than the others he seems to have little personal baggage against others in the conference hes won over a lot of the moderate holdouts that opposed jordan he appeals to the magatrumpreligious crowd

the gop is also exhausted and seems to be willing to settle at this point

217 is still a very tall order well have a better sense of his chances soon enough
this dude is just as crazy as gym jordan
its amazing how a few people can cripple the government of a country filled with 350000000 people
even if he gets elected hell need to keep the republican coalition together thats a tough ask for anyone the shit show wont be over
ah yes yet another member of the gop that i would trust less than a fart the morning after excessive drinking of cheap beer and taco bell
mike johnson looks like every douchebag boss who ever sexually harassed me in my 20s
caller im getting tired of us politics

me first time
please remember exactly zero republicans would have ever voted for pelosi
in a good drama tom emmer would burst into the chamber at the last second having made a secret deal with the democrats to be speaker
an independent who loves johnson hmm how many of these independents are actually just republicans who dont want to call the line
watching these people just constantly applaud themselves for absolutely nothing is so off putting
rep johnson is the kind of unknown who will likely be led by others  and likely down bad roads
congresswoman angie craig d of minnesota during the vote for house speaker just yelled happy wedding anniversary to my wife  hakeem jeffries

shes pissed she has to be there for this vote again
theyre realizing how bad this circus is making them look and are just like ok this guy
alright start playing ads in the moderate republican districts showing their representative bowed down to trump and voted for an election denier the gop may have stopped the bleeding for now but this move all but ensures the house is going democrat in 2024
i personally look forward to the likely parade of skeletons this guy has in his closet being marched out into daylight due to his new position
boebert and santos sitting next to each other cannot begin to imagine how dumb that conversation is
so as bad as this is for the remainder of this legislative term a new congress will be sworn in on jan 3 2025 and a new speaker elected before the vote to certify the electoral college on jan 6 2025 this doesnt necessarily portend any disastrous results for the next presidential election except it just reinforces republicans commitment to trump the big lie and undermining democracy in this country
this guy is insane levels of bad lol
but does he realize that us is like us
congratulations to scalise jordan emmer johnson
jesus these speeches are so disgusting these people are mentally ill
this caller i find it funny that the democrats are saying johnson is unqualified when then have ocasiocortez sitting in their ranks

aoc is way better than johnson theres no competition here
deleted
i read somewhere a gop insider said they think johnson will get the votes but also said after that the gop is fucked because its beyond impossible to get anything done with all the different factions and settling for a speaker doesnt solve the issues in the caucus johnson has no leadership experience and itll take weeks to get a full staff hired and the gop has no time before the government would shut down
im really nervous that this is going to be it and that it will be worse than if they had chosen jim jordan
i have a hard time believing that mike johnson isnt just a front controlled by jim jordan and the freedom caucus
obligatory religion shouldnt be in government comment
so is johnson another shithead
oh look an independent who loves a r shocked i tell you
democrats have no chance of winning 

obviously theyre the fucking minority
reporter told to shut up for asking johnson about over turning the election httpstwittercomacynstatus1717013355775545630
so hes a right wing  maga election denier anti vaxxer climate change denier anti abortion  want to gut social programs etc etc

hes gym jordan in a better suit
mike johnson is an election denier  

tom emmer who was one of only two republicans to vote to certify the 2020 election didnt stand a chance in this extreme party  

this is the republicans guy because this is trumps guy  the gop is a full on cult a cult of personality in the house for the clicks and chaos  and a cult following to the former president now indicted for multiple felonies
shes just outright making crap up now i hate this so damn much smug ignorant utterly dangerous hacks
with the new maga forced speaker how long before they try to strip anyone who wasnt voting for jim jordan of any of their committee seats
but for nancy mace have her scarlett letter on today  what a stupid republican party
looks like they finally got the right blackmail material out of the safe they are going to elect a speaker
well  still plenty of time for a few republicans to grow a pair and not vote for him but this one  feels like its gonna go through  

look at it this way  it was more or less guaranteed we were going to end up with some right wing nutjob as speaker   the maga crowd was going to sink anybody else  

this is the expected outcome and its now up to the democrats to attempt to limit the damage until they control the house again  thats always been the assignment
to think how very close we were to having a democratic house majority  god so much time would have been saved so much real work could have been done so many people could have gotten real help in their lives instead we have these soulless hateful scheming dirtbags getting their paychecks for doing nothing of value to anyone except themselves and those they deem like them pretty damn discouraging but weve just got to do more to get them out of office in the next elections
they wasted 3 weeks and now this guy is getting pushed through in less than a day seems awfully suspect i am very uncomfortable with this
jeffries

jeffries

jeffries

as is tradition
well weve all got some elections in november it looks like so if anything you can always make them feel their choices then and this one is a particularly recent choice theyve made themselves look fucking awful for almost a month now you cant tell me theres no backlash incoming for that
the grossest part will be the gip taking a victory lap on all the shows trying to talk about how unified they are and how they beat the democrats
the government is gonna be shut down i can give some historical examples at what happens when you fail to pay your troops but im tired so ill summarize its bad
so what happens in 3 weeks when johnson needs to work with dems to pass a budget does he get voted out
well there you have it folks after three weeks and four rounds of voting mike johnson is now the speaker of the house yet another election denier is the speaker
well kids it was funny while it lasted 

back to your posts need to batten down the hatches
republicans have spent half a century complaining about how government doesnt work hopefully this episode will be the final example needed to convince the remainder of the public that the reason shit doesnt always work is because these assholes have dedicated their lives to alternately sabotaging it and resisting fixing it
republicans in unison who is mike johnson
i wonder how long it takes the freedom caucus to decide they want to blow everything up again just because they got together on one vote doesnt mean theyre all buddybuddy in the background now
i cannot wait for speaker jeffries once day
i dont think voting to overturn the election was the dealbreaker for the 26 antijordan gop members i think they just couldnt stand him as a person

they were all on board with mccarthy who tried to overturn the election too they seem to be all onboard for this johnson guy too
suggested songs for todays proceedings

you dont have the votes from hamilton  a little too on the nose

road to nowhere talking heads

theme from whos the boss

any other suggestions
the gop sure knows how to exhaust and tire everyone around them even among themselves that theyll get the same kind of insurrectionist as jordan into having the gavel

if they somehow keep the house next year then it says how much their tactics continuously work for themselves and so these kinds of circuses will define how republicans govern till the end of time 

and why would they ever change the cons always been like this since 2010 their base and by extent apathetic americans who cant ever be arsed to vote themselves to have a say in this keep on rewarding this behavior
from wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikimike_johnson_louisiana_politician

johnson is known for his strong support for a nationwide abortion ban23 and opposition to samesex marriage he has called for the supreme court decision obergefell v hodges to be overturned and for medical marijuana to be restricted referring to the latter as a gateway drug in december 2020 johnson signed an amicus brief in support of texas v pennsylvania a lawsuit filed at the supreme court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election in january 2021 johnson voted to overturn the election results in pennsylvania4 johnson has cultivated close ties to protestant fundamentalist groups louisiana family forum alliance defending freedom and focus on the family56 prior to his career as a politician he worked with them to represent churches pastors and congregants whose vision of religious freedom conflicted with government regulations2 johnson supports ending american military aid to ukraine in its war against russia2
ken buck you spineless coward
you can tell by how overly confident they are when they say his name that hes going to get the votes
lol republicans literally had to field an inexperienced nobody that they could secure votes on before anyone actually researches what he has said or done

careful maga crew theres a video where he said hed work with democrats better push this novice through before bobo and mtg see it

bidens team is gonna eat this guy for breakfast
the calculus is easy if youre a squish like fitzpatrick or bacon theyre tired of this and johnson isnt nationally coded as insane like jordan its the moderates who dont care about policy in the house gop
its gonna be fun watching johnson flail around useless as a fish out of water when he realizes legislating is way harder than it looks
we are back better than ever with mike johnson

shut the fuck up
we are back and better than ever bro be real lmaoo
well i definitely gave him less credit than he deserved i was pretty sure his bid would blow up as well

i guess well see what happens in 21 days my guess is a shutdown well see how things go
another maga pos for speaker 

whats going to stop him from contesting the election results next year and throwing another insurrection party
this guy knows trump added the most to that debt right  right
let me guess your plan to fix the increasing debt is tax cuts for the rich
a creationist and fanatic evangelical is now speaker of the house insanity has taken over
do they need to do this pat on the back bullshit get the fuck back to work assholes quit freeloading off my taxes lazy ass mofos
interestingly cnn says johnsons spending plan to keep the government open is another cr  on the surface that makes sense given the time wasted but its hilarious given that this is what got kevin canned and johnson voted against the last cr   
reporter you helped lead the effort to overturn the 2020 election results do you

republicans boo shut up

httpsxcomacynstatus1717013355775545630s20
republican caller blaming democrats for not voting for republicans
its the democrats fault for not being the adult in the roomthis lady is on crack
whats a maga democrat lol
a quote from rep charlie dent i think mike johnson is going to probably win today simply because they are all exhausted
democrats calling in telling republicans to vote for hakeem jeffries is so funny its like the ultimate taunt
as a christian i think i am probably more offended by stefanik quoting the bible like this than if i were an atheist
this is a reminder that this country does not actually have moderate right wing politicians they find it more politically viable to lie manipulate deceive abuse propagandize and attack
just a brit casually watching from abroad and this feels extremely dragged out we drag our speaker to the chair like were drunk and it gets done within seconds and honestly based on how that republican woman was speaking i think she might also be drunk
every time republicans start quoting bible verses in a speech on the floor as elise stefanik did this morning after lying about and trying to overturn an election after the violent january 6 attack its confirmed the republican party is a cult
holy hell that nominating speech by that gop member was terrifying   


edit it was elise stefanik  
her full speech httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3qmov9hzsd8httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3qmov9hzsd8
with this vote the republicans are slouching to electoral disaster in 2024
so were either going to have a government shut down or were going to end up in this very same position again in a matter of weeks when he helps get a funding bill passed that the freedom caucus doesnt like great job gop hacks
lol why do they applaud when the nominees vote for themselves stupid political theater
there are no moderate republicans just batshit maga and nutless maga
just another day closer to the facist theocracy nbd
mccarthy jordan scalise and johnson were among 147 republicans who voted in favor of overturning the 2020 election results
somebody on the gop side just voted for my brother in christ mike johnson  my eyes are rolling about as hard as they can
on the upside the gop leadership is incredibly inexperienced thats generally bad for a party
im sure johnsons not going to be denying the outcome of this election for some reason
now its time for the dccc to get their asses in gear and make sure independents and moderates in swing districts know who their representative just voted for
alright how long do we think mike johnson is going to last im guessing if he gets another cr passed when the current one is up gaetz will move to sack him
im coping with the fact that trumps stain and roe v wade carried over through the midterms so trumps stain and the incompetence of the republican party should be no different

x200b

i need some more copium tho
first mccarthy now johnson republicans love inssurectionist speakers the status quo remains 

now lets move on and get some aid to our international allies republicans have done enough damage
so the controlling party of the house of representatives did the absolute fucking minimum jesus christ this government sucks have some goddamn sense of urgency you pricks
elise give it a rest 

you nominated three others before johnson
deleted
holy shit i shouldnt be surprised that such a bigoted person that wanted to overturn an election was elected to represent republicans but here i am the bar never hits the bottom
mike johnson looks like a villian from a disaster movie
if the supposed moderate republicans vote for johnson it just goes to show the party does not have any real moderates anymore youre either maga or not republican now you need to have denied the election and you need to have sufficiently sucked up to trump
folks we just had a sane cspan caller  do whatever it is we do when theres one of those

thanks glenda from kansas city youre a real one
there are a lot of stupid voters out there regarding the cspan callers how do you think we got in this mess in the first place

someone is voting in these republicans and sadly a lot of them are going to keep doing it even after this disaster hell they kept doing it after 2016 theyre not stopping now

just have to keep out voting them and registering more young people and hoping enough people wake up
why should democrarts go across the aisle to support any of the republicans
caller im an independent 

also caller i think an election denier is awesome and heres the gop talking points that blame democrats but im totally a independent

me okay buddy sure youre totally an independent
mary ann democrat from north carolina

she has actually done her research concerned about his lack of experience fair sees him as an election denier true shes citing his various legislative actions says hes not a conservative
mark republican from ohio

hes watched the decline of everything claims mike johnson has reached across the aisle and claims the democrats are radical democrats disrespect everybody and theyre just so radical 

moved off him really fast
i teach high school civics and hear more coherent opinions about this stuff in class than i do listening to cspan
florida man on cspan spitting facts pointing out the johnson is basically another jordan and that the far right despite their claims to represent the people are a minority among the public
what the fuck  why are they giving a standing ovation to pointing out a decoration and incorrectly calling it the nations motto i know it was voted for but that is a left over from a response to the evil atheist communists during the cold war

the nations motto is e pluribus unum
god this is a sickening speech
these fake ass christians and their fake ass christianity makes me want to throw up
aguilar feeling sassy today
so what happened within that conference yesterday that got all these holdouts on board with this guy
gaetz went for johnson theyve finally settled on this piece of shit being their speaker i guess
the stranglehold trump and maga have on the republican party really needs to be studied
looks like johnson might win bad day for democracy btw listened to the speeches and literally wtf was the republican speaker  talking about sounded like a sermon with a bunch of bs insane talking points that i have no idea what theyre based on
stupid question incoming just saw a guy say that johnsons first order as speaker will be to introduce legislation to defund jack smiths office he cant do that right plus it would have to pass the senate id think
the post blaming the democrats for not voting for liz cheney while ignoring that it was the republicans who literally turned on liz cheney and their voters who kicked her out of office is possibly the dumbest spin i have seen yet

hey democrats why didnt you save the most hardcore conservatives ever who the republicans turned on

the democrats cant fix the fact the republican party is broken and has gone full maga only the republican voters can fix that and the independents by not voting republican anymore thats the only cure for this disease
it took them three weeks to do step 1 after gaining the majority in the house
now we can get back to the important things like sharing dick picks of hunter biden and getting mad at bud light or something
holy shit why does he need so many escorts to walk 30 feet
house finally has a speaker as mike johnson wins after weeks of chaos  
httpswwwtheindependentcomnewsworldamericasuspoliticsmikejohnsonhousespeakerrepublicansb2435884html
man those election ads is gonna write themselves thanks gop
i hate the guy but it would be hilarious if matt gaetz stood up in the middle of this meandering shit and called for a vote to remove the speaker
great  an evangelical that doesnt think gay marriage should be legal climate change is a hoax and defended trumps impeachment and probably doesnt give a hoot about the separation of church and state
not taking questions coward
heres something alarming from cnn

and i quote gop house speaker mike johnson once wrote in support of the criminalization of gay sex calling it a dangerous lifestyle

rightwing america you are broken
so is the key to success in the republican party to be a complete unknown because otherwise you have history and everyone will know how horrible you are
if this vote fails the gop will have a better chance of getting a speaker from craigslist
if todays vote fails mchenry might actually be speaker longer than mccarthy
lets keep government functioning by electing a guy who wants to shut the government down
republicans stand up to their leadership

what leadership they literally dont have a person who can get the party together and lead it
the american people will need to do their own research like my politics facebook group we send each other links and stuff
hakeem is right we already had an election denier as a speaker mccarthy was one
its at least nice to hear booing of her speech it deserves to be booed
good on the democrats booing the lies and conspiracy theories coming from stefanik
fuck this elise was the worst person to do this yeah i was wrong theres no saving the party its over


fuck the republicans all of them
i cannot stand it when our politicians use bibleverses to justify their decision making shut the fuck up about galatians 69 i dont give a fuck not everyone in this country believes in god no matter how much the repubs want them to

get your god out of my government
feel like hes going to get it  ugh dont want an election denier
it always gets me how much more diverse the democrats side is compared to republicans
all enemies foreign and domestic

looking at you republicans
i guess from bucks perspective johnson didnt really believe the election was stolen like jordan he was just using it to pander to the base and sow division clowns
if johnson does get the speaker role whats special about him that they could unite behind him but not behind mccarthy scalise jordan or emmer is he just as farright as jordan but doesnt have the baggage of being as in the spotlight
servant leader mike johnson

so cringe
it sucks when mcconnell is probably the most stable national leader the rs have
welp looking like weve got another election denier as speaker at this rate

mccarthy likely was the better choice compared to johnson 
johnson is just plain dangerous how many guilty pleas on the election scam do people need the election was not rigged  pleaded guilty proves it lying pos the gop is just anti democratic sore losers with a fraud as thier leader
imagine if this was like a nice automated process where everybody could vote in 3 minutes they might actually have time to do something productive they wouldnt
so how bad is the next shutdown going to be now
i think that johnson is going to learn that he just got elected to the worst job in congress
theyre applauding like they accomplished something you flung a plate of food on the walls and now want to act like you can lead because you cleaned it up
you heard it here first 2020 is not the only time this guy will vote against certifying an american election in order to hand donald trump a participation trophy
congrats to the gop for doing the absolute bare minimum
doesnt matter  their party is clown shoes
johnson joins as a number 2 or second speaker after mccarthy was voted out mccarthy was the first speaker to take 15 votes to win his role and was the first speaker to be kicked out of his job the vote was called by his own party his own party then cheered and clapped for him when he voted johnson lol
why did they unify for johnson
how about taxing the rich
this slightly comedic attempt at christofascist speech is nauseating
a fucking seditionist is house speaker  im just fucking nauseous
cspan republican caller from johnsons district hes been defending the constitution for years i know him very well hes honest principled a christian youre in good hands and you can trust him

yeahno
congress woman virigina foxx yelled shut up at a reporter who asked mike johnson if he was an election denier

thats straight up out of the fascist playbook
if all this bothers you get involved to get these rs out of office

join rvotedem phonebank textbank volunteer knock on doors or donate make a plan to vote and take someone with you
so johnson cant

 raise money to help support the party
 appeal to a moderate base to help keep control of the house
 admit when free and fair elections happen
 supply aid to our allies who help keep the us safe

great choice republicans cant wait to see this guy fail spectacularly at passing a budget in a few weeks
yikes just checked out his history 

gop caucus going from mccarthy to johnson is like switching from meth to crack

there is no reality this will end well
removed
wow they went with one of the craziest
im holding out hope that some of the mccarthy voters keep holding out to keep johnson out many of them didnt follow his endorsement for jordan and they were stubborn enough to vote for him even in the closed door meeting when there was no point to it fingers crossed theyre just quieter about their opposition in the news than maga but still vote against johnson
the reason hes going to win is everyone is thinking who the fuck is this guy when he actually has to do work well find out all of this is pointless if nothing gets done also turns out this guy was an election denier so hes already hated by the sane left and hes viewed with skepticism by the moderate republicans who are just broken to the point they want an anyone
in september 2016 mike johnson characterized his legal career as defending religious freedom the sanctity of human life and biblical values including the defense of traditional marriage and other ideals like these when theyve been under assault

arent defending religious freedom and simultaneously defending traditional biblical values in conflict  if he doesnt see that hes a moron
you guys listening to cspan are there any liberalleaning callers from the comments here its like a hundred percent mental asylum hotline lmao
johnson has the advantage of being right there with the craziest members without ever attracting enough attention to deny plausible deniability from tbe moderates

was he as crazy as jordan  sure but we didnt know that when we voted him in
lol maga democrats
my man said maga democrats
lol this independent is acting like hes superior because hes independent but can barely string along a coherent sentence
cspan host trying desperately to get people to actually talk about johnson
this host is a fucking hero to listen to these idiots all day  ten minutes in and i want to engineer a virus to wipe out half of humanity
this speech from stefanik is offensive
a friend to all and an enemy to nonestefanik

x200b

unless you want to certify a free and fair election  then you might be his enemy
7th bible verse everybody drink
here come the jeers from the same people who booed reporters for asking them to answer for their bullshit
johnson has a real shot at winning and personally i think him winning would be worse than having mccarthy and possibly jordan johnson is younger and could really use this and i think its going to surprise people how unified they are

i dont like him either way and i have a very uncomfortable feeling about him republicans tend to bend the knee when they absolutely have to and i just cant shake the idea he may have got some to do so now to end this well see but i dont like any of this
i would have started the democrat nominating speech with dear republicans what the fuck was that elise stefaniks speech was scary
mike johnson sounds like the name scammers in india use when they try to convince you theyre from the irs
is the it only takes a single person to demand a vote of no confidence and oust someone rule still going to be in effect for this next speaker
dems should get on the offensive about this johnson guy as soon as this is done get the attack ads fired up and tell people the whole republican caucus is maga extremism
they only united around him as hes not got any real record in leadership

as soon as he has to do anything controversial or challenging hell get the boot were only a few weeks away from potential shutdown
not quite as bad as jordan but close good grief the voters need to unequivocally denounce this statement next year
what concessions did this guy make to unite the rs
i would think you would want to elect someone who believes in elections to head the elected body of lawmakers but what do i know
they cant actually let this sack of shit be speaker right jfc

this clerk recorder has been working there for a long time
im actually pretty bullish on johnsons prospects for longevity as speaker  i am predicting that hell last between two and five months enough time to pass a normal continuing resolution to keep the governments lights on through the end of the 2023 election season  then i imagine the wheels will fall off around the time they go to pass the budget through the somewhat convoluted process described by johnson in his dear colleague letter httpswwwscribdcomdocument680053508mikejohnsonpolicydearcolleague
republicans spend their campaigns claiming government is incompetent and malicious then spend their terms in office proving it
did johnson agree to that crazy shit mccarthy agreed to where gaetz or whoever can easily oust him
did they leave the motion to vacate in place
not many any republicans clapping in agreement over biden winning 2020
are people really crowing when jeffries brought up jan 6th how insane
this is bad this is very very bad johnson is a big proponent of the independent state legislature theory
lots of god talk for the leader of a secular governing body
in editorials that ran in his local shreveport louisiana paper the times johnson called homosexuality a inherently unnatural and dangerous lifestyle that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy the entire democratic system
what a giddy little shitweasel stefanik is
well there we have it the same rules package is in effect so we can have a repeat of mccarthys outing
just early voted in texas there are 14 constitutional amendments up for grabs and elections like this are very low turnout so your vote could very well carry more weight than usual if you show up and there wont be long lines or wait times

httpswwwtexasstandardorgstoriestexaspropositionselection2023earlyvoting

heres a nice simple article summing up the issues i wont comment on most of them but i will briefly discuss 7 and 12

amendment 7 is very deceptively labeled being listed as an amendment to modernize the power grid right on the voting ballot but what it actually aims to do is open up more gas plants while defunding green infrastructure

texas receives more sun than any state in the country our energy problems primarily come from not being connected to the national grid and poorly using the resources we do have available i dont think we can get rid of fossil fuels in the short term and gas plants are at least somewhat better than coal but anything that doesnt connect us to the national grid and expand green energy in this state is the literal opposite of modernization and i say this as someone who shakes his fist at electric bills regularly my vote for this one is a solid no

amendment 12 is about removing the treasurer in galveston for extremely moderate tax savings around 500k which doesnt actually translate to much in terms of redistributing to other resources like roads as claimed let alone going back to the taxpayers however it is instead removing a check and balance on the system that we may not seem to need now but we sure as heck could someday anybody who understands how the gop operates knows they love to remove a check and balance from a system they intend to exploit in the following years dont fall for it

while this is on the statewide balance it can be flipped in the galveston county voters vote differently than the rest of the state on this issue apparently so if you live and know people in galveston encourage them to vote now my vote for this one is a solid no

the above article does a good job of summarizing the vote on the other 12 issues i support better salaries for teachers funding for parks ect ect but i wont make a long writeup on those here
mccarthy scalise jordan emmer johnson they all were involved in trying to rig the vote for trump and overthrow the government every candidate they put forth was more or less the same on the issue of 2020 disturbing yes but johnson being speaker hardly changes the calculation all the gop managed to do was embarrass themselves show how dysfunctional their caucus is and select a guy who is just a weaker version of the last guy same shit different day
please stop doom spiraling the republicans had a majority and it was very unlikely to go anywhere but to a republican we managed with kevin who is an election denier and we will manage with johnson 

remember a few things 

we saw how dysfunctional the gop was throughout kevins reign 

we got 21 days of no speaker after going through 3 other candidates from their own fault

even if johnson is elected which right now seems certain there is no guarantee it will go any better for republicans  

they still need to vote on another israelukraine package and we need to fund the government next which will be a test of how well this guy can actually hold his conference together

as always remember to vote this year and especially next year
the doom scroll is insufferable the gop has the majority and mccarthy was a lying sack of crap who couldnt be trusted and bent over to the farright every second this was the only outcome 

just because they elect this guy doesnt mean the problems of the last 3 weeks suddenly went away if anything its amplified because they settled just to settle on a speaker who has no leadership background and is a pr nightmare for the gop with his abortion and lgbtq views when they have to start working again the same problems will still be in the gop caucus and 10000xs worse because so many bridges were destroyed nobody trusts anybody
people need to stop dooming

gop has the majority

every nominee should have been expected to be the speaker

just do your part vote get people to vote

2024 is more important than this speaker drama
removed
im gonna call my shot at risk of being proven a fool and say that mike johnson gets elected speaker on the second ballot of the day no one is going against him on the record and we have no idea of any of the absentees are against him either
it says a lot that the quote unquote moderate candidates do not even have an opportunity to have a vote essentially that tells us that the freedom  jackass caucus is directly telling them they will not be allowed to win and the fact that the nonmoderates are getting votes tells you that the so called moderates are less firm
well because of the overnight hes already lasted longer than emmers which is approximately 180th of a scaramucci give or take
pro religion anti science
lol independent caller blaming the democrats for the gop clusterfuck
feels like a big moment are the nonmaga republicans going to surrender
another independent

what is a magademocrat
steve independent from alabama

he loves being an independent and sees the circus among the maga democrats what loves that mike johnson isnt some sort of 60 something old person more people should do their own research and be independent like him
do your own research
mike johnson started the republican meeting with a prayer

hes getting all 221 first ballot isnt he
hearing republican voters talk in realtime is both fascinating and frightening
everything im reading says this guy will probably be the next speaker 

i know as people who actually care about democracy its very upsetting to see a traitor be put 2nd in line to the president but just remember its for a short time and this will only help dems in the house and the senate races this will help dems massively with independents and motivate gen z and more millennials to get out and vote 

the gop wants to elevate their worst its all the culture war if they want to put up someone who tried to end our democracy so be it cant wait to vote them out and regain the house senate will be tough but we will keep the white house
i have a feeling like this is gonna be over today

positive his inexperience versus that of biden or schumer should be stark and he might flounder from that

negative an absolutely insane electiondenier is going to be secondinline for the presidency
so johnson is as bad as any freedom caucus member but he has been loud and upfront about it so hell be able to secure the votes

a damn insurrectionist as the speaker he should be in jail not 2nd in line
some of these representatives have been alive longer than in god we trust has been our motto
in god we trust

get god out of government
shit its religion in state affairs not this again
if a conservative breaks the law and the law comes for them that isnt targeting conservatives its justice just come out and say you think your above the law stop with the games
someone should tell johnson his glasses make him look like a gay dude and see how fast he throws them down
god this woman is loathsome
from now on when i manage to do even the basics of my job after utter incompetence and chaos for weeks im going to yell today is the day i get this done
that speech was so full of bullshit
i know nothing of this woman but in the five minutes she talked i lost all interest in any noise she has to sady for the rest of her existence full blown liar attacking half the country proudly showing support for god yet not believing in his teachings and ignoring everything he stood for
i really cant put into words how much i hate the republican party this speech is the biggest fairytale of grievances ive heard yet
mchenry is like please get me the fuck off this dais
the religious nuts have taken the wheel of their party they can deny it all they want they are against being anything but white and straight its just a fact groan all you want its the truth an america knows it
foreign and domestic loved that haha
johnson is more dangerous than jordan he has all the same repugnant political goals but where jordan looks like a frothing lunatic johnson keeps everything tucked away behind this polite churchgoing man veneer
republicans saw 2022 results and decided to make an election denier anti abortion rights anti gay marriage and guess this anti interracial marriage guy to be the speaker
bacon votes for johnson this is probably going to work
i do think johnsons got it and i really think thats a scary proposition
bacon is a coward
our long national nightmare is over and will become a new nightmare instead
republicans selecting a speaker doesnt really change things that much they still wont get anything done its just the votes wont all be about picking a speaker
looks like its over he seems to be getting all the gop votes
any bets on after they elect johnson weather they take the rest of the week off in celebration of a job well done
im half expecting statler and waldorf shouting one liners from the balcony during these proceedings
the three texas house republicans  kay granger jake ellzey and tony gonzales  who declined to vote  jim jordan have all voted for mike johnson as speaker
wtf
they got so embarrassed theyre settling for this clown cant get any sadder than this
honest question 

what did matt gaetz gain from this speaker change how can he justify it
with zero other votes so far its all but certain that this will pass
there are no moderate republicans
to anyone expressing disbelief that this guy would be elected  whoever we got was going to be this guy in one suit or another   any speaker this republican house was going to elect was going to be an election denier they were going to be super far right and they were going to be a trump puppet   that was the only thing on the menu  the maga contingent was going to shoot down anybody who didnt meet these requirements and the republicans slim majority essentially gave this handful of nuts veto power over any speaker vote
republicans elected a guy who wants to control your bedroom dictate what is and isnt allowed between you and your doctor and rejects democracy democrats should be screaming this from the rooftops
back better than ever is still dog shit on the shoe of america
welp there we go  

theres a new speaker
lmfao congratulations it only took you a month
if history has anything to say about this johnsons carrer will now go down the tubes
mindless gibberish from johnson saying trump won in 5 4 3
lol they ran out of options and had to elect whatever was leftover to end the embarrassment


wait until this guy opens his mouth and there will be a whole new chapter of embarrassment
and now i look forward to working with this guy for ever how long he lasts thank you
is this where gaetz calls for a motion to vacate
can you imagine the speech this guy must give when he gets picked up at last call he seems to think he won something
well yeah because you all raised the debt
election denier swearing to protect the constitution from enemies foreign and domestic
i wish these oaths were taken more seriously dude who has actively worked against the constitution just said he would protect and uphold it what a poor state our country is in
how can they cheer on the motion to inform president biden if they dont think hes the real president
trump and the far right got exactly everything they wanted gop mods are spineless cowards and they chose to throw the entire nation into another shutdown shitshow 
just in case there were any doubts every single house republican save onehttpsclerkhousegovevs2023roll527xml voted to elect an electiondenying fundie zealot conspiracist for house speaker the one who abstained from voting van orden from wisconsinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiderrick_van_orden is also an electiondenying fundie zealot conspiracist

remember this when theyre up for reelection there is no such thing as a moderate republican anymore
what sucks is the far right of the republican congress essentially launched a coup and won here johnson as speaker means disaster for budget negotiations mccarthy was a tool but he worked with democrats when necessary as a last resort to keep the country running i dont think that happens now
dude do your research

same dude supports the 2020 rigged election

me you are made of stupid
deleted
the reality is that only an insurrectionist can get the support of 217 republicans

so we might as well get past that and move on to watching an insurrectionist speaker try to govern
the speaker of the house endorsed a national abortion ban rip gop 2024
so this make it 100 likely the 2024 election will be challenged if trump doesnt win likely with more violence 

what power does johnson have over the ongoing court cases against trump anything he can touch he will likely be working to destroy 

trumpism is back in power
i cant wait for the upcoming scoop from a news outlet with more details on just how involved mike johnson was in the legal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results  you know its coming now that he has a massive spotlight on him after being a relative unknown even to political junkies
are people forgetting that mccarthy was an election denier and was already speaker there is no chance a nondenier is getting the position as long as republicans have any majority he also voted against 2020 certification he signed on to the texas lawsuit he fought against investigating jan 6 as house minority leader at the time and previous majority leader he had the power to spread and legitimize the message from the start

president trump won this election mccarthy said we cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes

httpswwwbusinessinsidercomkevinmccarthytrumpsfalseclaimthathewontheelection202011

everyone who is listening do not be quiet do not be silent about this we cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes

httpswwwpoliticocomnewsmagazine20201106theelectionthatbroketherepublicanparty434797

mccarthy threatens to strip gop members of committee assignments if they accept an offer from pelosi to serve on 16 commission 

httpswwwcnncom20210701politicskevinmccarthyjanuary6commissioncommitteeassignmentsindexhtml
its a pretty dark day when a literal christofascist is made speaker of the house 

im not being hyperbolic he wants to ban all abortion all same sex marriages immigration from brown countries he wants students to pray in public schools and he wants to ban even medical marijuana 

the only solace is that he has very little ability to actually accomplish any of these things with the current makeup of the government
for the love of god win back the house next year
did mike johnson just tell us that his wife has spent the last couple of weeks on her knees
god placed me here

oh fuck here we go
religion has no place in politics should be immediately ineligible for congress giving a speech like this  separation of church and state is in the constitution but apparently peabrain missed that
lmao this independent caller

all these failed votes is republicans sorting things out and working together if only democrats worked that way

these fucking loons
i have a hard time believing news outlets saying this time the vote will pass without there being some kind of concession that we dont know about yet
after edging us all day yesterday i want at least 2 votes and 4 outbursts to entertain me this afternoon
why is trump being so wishwashy on endorsing speaker i think its because he knows there is a good chance the vote will fail 

hes afraid to back the loser


 congratulations to congressional republicans yesterday was a big and very important day it gave us a quick and easy way forward with 5  candidates who are beyond reproach and represent the absolute best there is in the republican party even the fake news media is impressed with what took place yesterday and more importantly with the candidates themselves congratulations to reps byron donalds florida charles j chuck fleischmann tennessee mark green tennessee  roger williams texas  the ultimate winner of yesterdays vote by a significant margin mike johnson louisiana i am not going to make an endorsement in this race because i could never go against any of these fine and very talented men all of whom have supported me in both mind and spirit from the very beginning of our great 2016 victory in 2024 we will have an even bigger  more important win my strong suggestion is to go with the leading candidate mike johnson  get it done fast love djt
its funny how saying the pledge of allegiance is so deeply associated with being an elementary kid that when members of congress do it which is probably the more logical place for it they look like children
can cspan please hire bill murray to host these
an absolute disgrace that this guy looks like he is gonna get in this is why its hard to trust moderates they have no spine and always underestimate the fanaticism of the extremists
iran has been paying off obama

trump should be speaker

fuckin republicans man
is there a comedy troupe taking turns calling in to cspan this cant be real
can i call that cspan line from europe might as join in
man the fact bacon and crew caved for the first dude with jordans views who looksacts the part of a soft spoken politician speaks volumes they never minded the batshit crazy they just didnt like the jordan was so in your face about it
gaetx on cnn max in a divided government we need to change the rules to get what we want

guess that pesky constitution is just too strict for him
its the demmycrats fault they keep votin fer the same guy theyre wasting time why arent they fixing the republicans mess for them
obviously they could be wrong but the way the media and all these reporters are looking it sounds like johnson will be elected speaker
this guy did his own research yawn
maga democrats 
what the hell is a maga democrat
2012 romney voters might as well be stalinists to maga people
so a modernday republican
fucking hell what sliver of hope i had in moderate republicans is now gone

this whole episode was a golden opportunity to keep the hardliners in check and they didnt do shit
 signed an amicus brief in support of texas v pennsylvania which challenged election results

afaik he was one of the ones that lead that effortwrote the thing
i said i wouldnt vote for someone who denies denying the election
i like how he changed his rationalization to he only supported it in the courts which is how it should be done so hes not bad
i agree with most of what you said but just a small clarification the us wont default thats related to the debt ceiling which is already resolved for now what youre thinking of is the government shutting down which is certainly bad but not nearly as apocalyptic as a default
as i understand it a default isnt on the table that was pushed past even the 2024 elections but a government shutdown is still on the table which while not a default will still be a very very costly event for the us even outside of actual dollar amounts
its been 8 years and theyre still sucking this man off its crzy
thats actually funny 

edit so yes happy anniversary
i saw that lolol

fucking morons id ask them if this whole thing is embarrassing to them but everythings vetted users only
 every gop house member in a biden district just lost
 
 

yeah theyre cooked if the dnc does their job right
i pray that youre right and im an atheist
 every gop house member in a biden district just lost

i hope so too
as someone who is very informed in the us the first thing i check every time they select a new name is if they are a 2020 election conspiracy pusher and if they voted to overturn the election so far the only ones who get a hard push to the front are election deniers and that is terrifying emmer wasnt and we saw how long he lasted
this might helphttpsiredditk2feeuynkcwb1jpg
a very large portion of americans do not even know as much as you do  albeit that is my anecdotal experience 

i just want to know how to look away at this point  theres so much history being made at the moment it feels impossible to not keep up with the rapid pulse of news i want to make sure i understand what is happening and can speak to the facts and truth of the situation maybe at some point i wont have the anxieties and i too can go back to knowing nothing
i mean you dont even need all that

hes a republican you know he has no integrity and his character is shit
hilarious  first time ive seen this
all those ny freshman are probably gone first through redistricting but winning a biden double digit district isnt sustainable in a presidential year for them

tbh they probably see the writing on the wall and trying to squeeze as much out as they can because they know theyre gone
the fatal flaw in this line of thinking is assuming republicans have shame

they dont

the chaos is the point
i heard them hooting and hollering about electing this guylike hes the greatest thing ever 

ahemhes the 4th guy if he is so fucking great why wasnt he the first choice or the second choiceor the third

these people are incorrigible
its also done with the new house that gets sworn in jan 3rd
thank you sometimes i think people in these threads get off on unnecessary fearmongering
not to mention its a different congress anyway if its firmly republican at the time of certification then its likely trump won anyway
its less of a meltdown and more of a please do better
im not sure what they think theyre going to accomplish this congress is going to basically tread water until 2024 the only question is how many shutdowns we get to endure
thats the scary part this guy is many things but he isnt an idiot  hes a zealot
im not dead yet
there is always someone worse when it comes to the gop
he wont be speaker if that video gets more publicity before the vote
 i have no idea what to expect from him as speaker

whatever trump tells him to do
that doesnt say anything at all about him beyond that he said the right thing one time words are meaningless to these people 

if you have an example of him doing the right thing during the past four years ill listen
yep they wanted jordan without the baggage
they have no incentive to tell the truth because their job security is dependent on contrarianism
the last true moderates got primaried out back in 2010
mike johnson is even worse than jim jordan he just isnt as big of a attentionwhoring blowhard
no he is worse than mccarthy
they are all the same they all vote for the same things they all spew and regurgitate the same rhetoric they all even look mostly the same its not worth looking at which one is worse  they are all traitors who would gladly vote for someone who eats live puppies if it meant making someone else upset
because the constituents of moderates dont know him so they get less backlash
there are no moderates
yep almost like hes a liar and hypocrite
despite the fact that he has cost them the last three elections let them shoot themselves in the foot
republican moderates absolutely love getting fucked theres no other explanation for their spinelessness
he is mccarthy did not have the backing of the maga part of the party johnson does
exhaustion and being done with each other will be the biggest causes if he gets it i can definitely see them just saying fuck it
thats what im thinking

hell i half expect him to be kicked out in a week because he shook hands with a democrat once
also pissed that they went from a guy who supported the rights of gays to marry and within 24 hours swing to a bigot that hates the fact her family has the audacity to exist
if it is it is the chances of getting a non terrible gop speaker are pretty low well make due until the next election cycle
does a bear shit in the woods
yes he is
another one bites the dust by queen
a maga democrat is a maga republican who calls the dem line and feels a little bit of guilt
heres hoping
hes freedom caucus so freedom caucus will vote for him it was the moderates that were in question
thats because democrats are the party of america whereas republicans are the party of white nationalism
yes  hes a maga election denier who voted not to certify the 2020 election results

he shouldnt even be sitting in the house let alone being actual speaker
him having little to no beef with anyone in house gop being a smooth talker and moderate reps being pussies
because he has no name recognition and trump was like eh okay
maga but comes across as a nice unknown guy who isnt as embarrassing for the gop
the people that call into cspan are always the people that should never be listened to
mccarthy was ousted because he wasnt a big enough sack of shit for them
i think hes as bad as jordan but he hasnt gotten the media coverage due to lack of experience in the house for most people to be aware hell do a horrible job and i wouldnt be surprised if he leads congress to a shutdown
 believes in governing

maybe but he voted to reject the electoral votes
you might be right but i hope not he tried to overturn the election and all i ask at this point is that we get someone who will actually respect the will of the people
i did thats why i am no longer a republican
the freedom caucus showed they have a lot of power and influence gaetz comes out of this with a bigger national profile and more influence in the house
yeah but mccarthy kept breaking promises lying to dems even when working with them and then threw the dems under the bus after working with them hes a piece of shit too the continuing resolution that he passed with dem support before his ouster had nothing for ukraine either at the time johnson isnt a downgrade or upgrade from mccarthy hes just a sidegrade
and shes worn out
i was just thinking about him how can you have someone who was your choice for president not feel at home in your party 11 years later like people who were once viewed as great republicans are called rinos now and the party is completely buying into it fucking dick cheney has been called a rino   


if kissenger finally ever breaks his pack with the devil and dies i cant wait to hear the maga party talk about how they are happy they moved past that rino
theyre cowards man not even saying that as a dunk its just facts theyre old and spineless they know they have at best 10 more years before the coast off into oblivion and they dont want to rock the boat so theyre going straight over a cliff instead
moderates died with mccain they genuinely did what we have now is just shades of mental illness
there is no way a shutdown wont happen  i have folks talking cr but i dont see 1 def no cr if he is speaker and 2 absolutely no funding will be passed in three weeks even if johnson is speaker   hope i am wrong but zero faith with these toddlers
oof thanks for reminding me that we have to rely on the dnc to not fuck this up
i liked him better when i didnt know who the fuck he was
funny that the next line is come back on thursday
 he just isnt as big of a attentionwhoring blowhard

exactly if johnson gets elected speaker then they effectively used jordan to tank the criticism so they could sneak someone worse past the goal
people like arnie are in denial that the republican party has changed dude talks about the environment and climate change as something republicans care about because nixon created the epa the party is just full of extremists now httpsyoutubelyg5c8ginqwsir0yapo6vyxvtmcyj
isnt jamie harrison the new guy i think he did pretty well in 22 considering
my response to every republican politician
uh yeah best ever performance in a midterm under similar conditions if im not mistaken"

minnesotan here i feel like tom emmer keeps getting painted as a moderate republican but hes like 95 as awful as jim jordan 

emmer has  

 posted a video in 2022 of him firing an automatic rifle with the caption firepelosi pelosis husband was attacked in their home several days later 

 signed the amicus brief to contest the 2020 election on behalf of trump 

 voted against establishing an investigation into the jan 6th attacks 

 tried to pass a measure to subtract an employees tips from their hourly wage he claimed that servers could be making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year more than the restaurant owner 

 opposed legislation that would protect lgbt students from bullying his rationale i dont think we need more laws 

 voted to remove the minimum wage in minnesota

 voted for a conscience clause to allow pharmacists to refuse dispensing medication that they have religious or ethical beliefs against 

 openly stated in 2007 that i believe marriage is between a man and a woman 

 has pushed measures to eliminate the corporate tax in minnesota without any decreases to individual citizens tax rates

 supported stripmining measures on minnesotas iron range
representative jim banks of indiana is among those who says he wont vote for emmer on the floor

i cant go along with putting one of the most moderate members of the entire republican conference in the speakers chair banks said that betrays the conservative values that i came here to fight for

the overton window on a moderate republican has flown off the face of the earth these days
punchbowl reports dems are willing to work with emmer

house democrats tell us they find emmer the least objectionable gop speaker candidate theyd be open to helping him by sitting the vote out if they get private assurances that emmer will fund the government at levels negotiated in the debtlimit deal and put a ukraineplusisrael aid bill on the floor

httpspunchbowlnewsarchive102423punchbowlnewsam

i wouldnt trust any private assurances they dont keep to their public assurances as it is just look how quickly mccarthy walked back the spending agreement he made with biden
cnn 25 minutes ago
who is rep tom emmer the house gops new speaker nominee

cnn 21 minutes ago
tom emmer the house gops speaker designee has dropped out

absolute hilarity
why is everyone calling him moderate just checked his wiki page there is nothing moderate about someone wanting to do away with minimum wage take away healthcare ban same sex marriage end corporate taxes deny climate change etc

httpsenwikipediaorgwikitom_emmerpolitical_positions

but i guess not voting to overturn the election is enough now to be considered a moderate thats one hell of a shift of the overton window
 rep dan crenshaw rtexas meanwhile said that he has started socializing a plan to change the rules and elect a speaker by a plurality  meaning a candidate would need to get the most votes on the floor but not a majority



source for above quotehttpswwwpoliticocomliveupdates20231024congressemmersfloorstrategy00123248 i dare you guys to do this would be an epic self own
httpswwwthreadsnetmarceeliaspostcyyb7_r41pigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq

 dont forget emmer supported texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate the 2020 election results in georgia michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin

 he is a maga vote suppressor and election denier
its crazy to think that tom emmer who first came into office as a tea party extremist is now among the most moderate options for speaker thats on the menu  with trump the party didnt shift or creep to the right  it tumbled in free fall straight up to the edge of authoritarian fascism  

and its still atumblin folks
did you know that virginia kentucky mississippi ohio pennsylvania new jersey and many other states all have elections in two weeks

do you want this clownshow of a party in charge of your rights at the state level  especially virginia where theyre openly running on banning abortion  or pennsylvania where the gop nominee for state supreme court isnt sure if biden won the 2020 election

get out and vote  early voting is open now

better than 50 nos for gyms private vote but still not a great start
hardline conservative rep matt rosendale said its time to consider other candidates besides speaker designee tom emmer whos race for the gavel seems to be on thin ice

its time as in weve had a designee for a whole 4 hours and our cult overlord has spoken from his civil fraud trial
take the 26 people that opposed emmer and put them in one conference room then take the 2055 whatever the true  number would have been people that opposed jordan and put them in a second conference room

each room has one hour to make a list of speakers they will vote for at the end of the hour compare the lists pick any name that shows up twice if no names are repeated then youll know for certain this is an exercise in futility

some members have raised the idea of a kevin mccarthyjim jordan tag team to solve the speakership stalemate  with mccarthy returning as speaker and then making jordan his assistant speaker sources tell cnn

 news panel breaks into laughter as they report kevin mccarthy is now considering running for speaker again
its impressive how the house gop is managing to tar and feather its entire leadership with this process 

1 mccarthy elected speaker prolific fundraiser for members unceremoniously tossed from office and leadership probably wont bother continuing fundraising as hard as he had since all he wanted was the gavel 

2 scalise majority leader won secret ballot and became designee only to immediately be backstabbed by our next guy before even getting to a floor vote no confidence shown in his bid at all has to wonder who the backstabbers were 

3 jordan chairman of the powerful judiciary committee started his bid by undercutting the guy who beat him out and forced scalise to stand down with in 24 hours of becoming designee then forced floor votes to show how popular he was only to lose votes each round is then also tossed from designee status after 100 colleagues voted in a secret ballot to eject him after his supporters sent death threats to fellow republicans hes hurting the wrong people s

4 not to be finished 9 more candidates are now losing their own popularity contests all taking their own fun ego hits in conference learning just how little their colleagues feel about them 

its an incredible amount of totally selfinflicted damage that will have every leader looking over their shoulder wondering who will betray them next no matter how the vote ends up working out
haha mccarthy is trying so hard to gaslight people into thinking this whole debacle is democrats fault no one believes that and blames democrats luckily it even seems republicans realize that
rep troy nehls if we go to the floorill be nominating donald j trumpi think donald trump is the answerdonald j trump for 100 daysi told the president you may have to adjust your golf schedulebut i think he would be willing to do it

httpsxcomaccountablegopstatus1716875193141113007s20

good grief
this is totally going to end with mccarthy as the speaker again

calling it now

is it 2024 yet sigh
mccarthy refuses to make deals with democrats

mccarthy finally makes deals with democrats and then immediately renegs on them


mccarthy opens a sham of an impeachment inquiry against the democrats leader

mccarthy shits on democrats and blame them for him being an ineffective leader

nbsp

democrats lets mccarthy and republicans explode
 
nbsp

republican rep from south dakota republicans see how the democrats ousted mccarthy and they dont view a viable longterm partnership with them i do not see a deal being made across the aisle
ali vitali on msnbc its slightly disingenuous that mccarthy continues to say it was democrats doing this to him the call was coming from inside the house republicans have told democrats they never would have saved nancy pelosi if the situation were in reverse
from politicohttpswwwpoliticocomliveupdates20231024congressemmersfloorstrategy00123248 an interesting thought   

rep dan crenshaw rtexas meanwhile said that he has started socializing a plan to change the rules and elect a speaker by a plurality  meaning a candidate would need to get the most votes on the floor but not a majority  
  
  
it would essentially dare holdout republicans to vote for emmer otherwise theyd risk making hakeem jeffries the speaker  
  
  
  
if we are back in the same situation then these other options are on the table crenshaw said if you vote against your nominee you are voting for a democrat like you are literally voting for a democrat

emmer apparently wants to go out on the house floor and get his nuts publicly and repeatedly kicked as soon as possible

i suspect this was all just a fetish thing all along for him
about 10 republicans continue to say they will not support tom emmer on the house floor representative dan meuser of pennsylvania said complicating emmers path to the speakership
mccarthy is such a dbag talking to reporters a few minutes ago saying were in this position because eight of our members worked with all the democrats to make this happen i cannot stand these people no discussion of how their years of fear and blind idolatry of trump emboldened that crazy caucus in the first place no mention of how their policy work doesnt represent the majority of the country

is it too much to ask that the speaker be someone that wasnt part of an attempt to toss out the results of a free and fair election

raju what is the option now there are 26 republicans against emmer 

mccarthy alright lets not be so negative

raju youve gone three weeks without a speaker
mccarthy expressed anger at the eight who voted to remove him as speaker blaming them for the chaotic situation republicans are in  
  
every member is tired of this every member is tired of those eight who worked with every single democrat he said the eight members worked with every single democrat to put us in this place so were tired of that  that is why were where we are

no youre where you are now because the gop is infested with people who prefer to actively fight governance or even hate what their job is meant to be while someone else governs instead blame yourself for giving gaetz the solo power to call the vote blame yourself for not even trying to make a deal with the democrats i hate how they keep trying to pretend like it was the democrats job to vote for the republicans speaker just out of the goodness of their hearts
there are a couple of dozen maga republicans who refuse to vote for a moderate speaker there are a couple of dozen moderate republicans who refuse to vote for a maga speaker

there are 170ish to 180ish republicans who just want to vote for anyone any republican that is and to move on from this the republican party is essentially two separate incompatible parties

any republican who depends on democratic votes or abstentions would be labeled as the democratic speaker and would lose significant republican support and likely face a motiontovacate vote again if a miracle happened and a handful of republicans voted for hakeem jeffries he would face a motiontovacate vote before the week is out

so cooperation is impossible and compromise is impossible is there any way out of this

note moderate has lost all meaning in the english language but thats where we are
trump just derailed the speakership of the us house while sitting in a courtroom for the civil fraud trial of his business empire and listening to the testimony of michael cohen1httpstwittercomkyledcheneystatus1716885043757613342
trump destroyed your red wave which put you in this position in the first place this is your chance to finally tell him off and go against him

house republicans how about no
its kinda hilarious to dip into rconservative and read any of the threads related to the speakership everyones a rino in there everyone seems to be a closet liberal i know you shouldnt read into reddit discussions for real world patterns but it really does feel like the conservative movement is tearing itself apart at the moment
no one endorsed by trump can become the speaker no one opposed by trump can become the speaker if theyre not willing to concede to democrats which so far they are not

its a fascinating paradox

i think i understand speed dating now
its pretty simple republicans just need to nominate someone who denies the results of the 2020 elections but also accepts them someone who will cut cut funding to ukraine but also send them money someone who will publicly offer to deepthroat trump but also wants to distance themselves from him
sounds like the freedumb caucus wont vote for someone who certified the 2020 results this is a problem
the previous house speaker got removed

the house majority leader didnt have enough confidence for a single house vote

the farright leader of multiple committees didnt have enough votes in the house after multiple tries

the house majority whip was candidate for speaker for less than six hours

how much longer is the republican party going to continue this farce there are enough moderates that they wont vote for just anybody and there are enough extremists trump included that theyll hardline anyone they deem not on their side

they are the victims of their own rhetoric from 2012 onward painting the democrats as the ultimate evil and thus a worse option than literally nothing if they continue to be unable to unite behind somebody and refuse to work with the democrats in any capacity then i cant see how this doesnt ultimately split the party for real
no speaker vote expected on the house floor tonight

 cnnhttpswwwcnncompoliticslivenewshousespeakervote102423indexhtml
rep kevin hern rokla announced tonight that he has dropped out of the house speakers race ahead of an 8 pm conference vote
i like that the idea that even non house members can be the speaker comes from air bud logic that well theres nothing in the rules that say a dog cant play basketball

theres nothing in the rules that says a dog cant be speaker
have republicans considered that theres nothing in the house rules that says the speaker cant be a dog
if the red wave happened in 2022 like so many conservative commenters were so sure of then we wouldnt be in this mess and i mean this in the best way having such a slim majority showed republicans as who they really are i just pray that americans are paying attention

i bet mccarthy was so pissed seeing the slim majority if the republicans had a 20 seat majority he would have had the easiest time keeping that speakers gavel
some gop reps seem to declare a run for speaker just to be able to drop out and thus remove themselves from consideration in some sense running for speaker now means _not_ running for speaker at least it should because absolutely no one seems to have the votes
httpswwwtexasstandardorgstoriestexaspropositionselection2023earlyvotinghttpswwwtexasstandardorgstoriestexaspropositionselection2023earlyvoting

daily reminder that early voting on 14 constitutional amendments has started in texas small elections like this tend to have the most reach and give the best opportunity to help decide long term policies so please dont forget to vote if you are able

the above is a nice straightforward article for reading up on each issue to help make an informed decision
its funny this thread has been up for how long and emmer is out and yet hes still listed as the potential candidate for speaker

at this point we can just admit that republicans for all the malice the vileness the harm they cause to our democracy and the harm they personally inflict its like watching an asshole get a sledgehammer into the balls
this doesnt matter and no one will care but i decided to listen to my local republican talk show on the way home from work 

the best idea a caller could come up with was tucker carlson for speaker

the host was 100 on board great idea and will fix everything 

thats the reality these people live in its not funny or entertaining they do not want real solutions they want talk show hosts from rich families running the country

you cant ever work with someone like that they will always stab you in the back

118th house republicans might be the least competent group of politicians since the civil war
lets not attribute this to planning it reeks of incompetence

the groups of people opposing each speaker nominee are different mccarthy was booted by a different group than the ones fighting scalise which in turn opposed jordan and now emmers been booted by a rough faction this isnt organized action its basic chaos

i do think trump may have been motivated to prolong the chaos its kind of his thing but in general the house doesnt have a speaker because republicans are that bad at this
honestly itd be hilarious if mccarthy ends up as speaker again lol

its really important that the speaker of the house have a good relationship with the leader of our party thats donald trump
as speaker designee tom emmer works behind the scenes to win over the 26 gop members against him gop rep mario diaz balart said that if emmer cant flip votes thats when it gets a little scary

if tom emmer cant do it then thats when it gets a little scary because remember hes the whip he knows how to count votes he has the relationships with every member of the conference the florida republican said

if emmer fails to clinch 217 votes among republicans there is no consensus on a backup plan 

lmao there was a plan to begin with
gop now i know all these guys just lost to emmer but maybe one if them will be the guy who can bring us all together 

what a shit show
we held 5 secret ballots and one roll call vote in the race for speaker today 


i voted jim jordan on all six ballots

 thomas massie


well theres one of the eggheads
remember were paying these people 174000 a year there are 221 republican representatives so thats 38454000 we are spending on this disaster
a party that looooves contrarianism and expects it from its elected officials and demands that it elect outsiders to take on the establishment republicans has a difficult time coming up with a near consensus on something as basic as choosing the speaker for their majority

every vote is an opportunity for a fresh 20 or 30 to take their turn to flex their contrarian bonafides their outsiderness every speaker candidate is the establishment enemy they all must do their performative contrarian actions their antiestablishment crusading its part of their identity

and in the chaos the lack of norms the lack of common purpose comes an authoritarian type to fill in the vacuum trump utters that emmers is not the right one and within 3 hours the top speaker candidate guy is personanongrata
if this goes on until january who sits behind the president during the state of the union and makes faces

stefaniks 4th congratulations speaker designate tweet in the past 3 weeks
so the final ballot has been tallied and the winner is jeb

inhales boi
i like the idea that the guy whose job its been over the past three weeks and failed miserably at to count votes for mccarthy and then scalise and then jordan is now doing the same for himself  fourth times the charm
its so insane that trump is the frontrunner for the party the party is fighting over the speaker and trump deliberately made the situation worse by shitting all over the current candidatewhat a time to be alive
so the culture wars about crt and drag queens are over yeah feel like we havent heard about those in a while

good lord republicans are fucking pathetic

a new candidate is put forward and we have to ask if he believes in election results or if hes a braindead cult member in two years were going to have to ask if he believes in gravity or if the earth is flat or not

notice the concern among republicans here none of them are worried that were like 13 business days away from a shutdown theyre not concerned that the military is currently operating on a cr which severely limits a number of initiatives theyre not concerned that people are losing out on having food available to them because theyve lost ebt card benefits under snap due to the farm bill expiring theyre not concerned that our allies and their favorite strawman israel are looking to the us for leadership nope theyre not even remotely concerned about their constituents at all theyre concerned about their careers fuck these clowns
man the writing for this season is dragging were still on the 2023 speaker arc
at this point i just want them to nominate every single republican rep once just to see the votes theyd get  lets have 200 lightning rounds in a row  see who comes out with the most support
after rep tom emmer dropped out of the speakers race someone made a motion to just start going down the list of candidates who came in behind emmer  starting with rep mike johnson  and voting on whether they should be speaker until they find someone who can get 217 sources tell cnn 

but the motion was rejected sources said 

still it shows just how desperate republicans are at this moment with the gop at a complete loss over how to once again pick up the pieces

bravo republicans well played you have proven to us all that you are fit to govern
emmers run as candidate lasted only 35 hours or approximately 0013 mooches

offices held for less than a day should be measured in emmers

i am withdrawing my name from consideration for house speaker at this time
i nominate selina meyer  her experience as president of the senate should help her keep the house in line
trump just called emmer a rino on the truth social
emmer facing stiff resistance 

mtg is a solid no said she voted for jordan and will continue to do so

gop rep jim banks from indiana went on cnn and said i  came to washington to fight for conservative values i cant go along with putting one of the most moderate members of the entire republican conference un the speakers chair that betrays the conservative values i came here to fight for


freedom caucus chair scott perry says he has concerns over emmers speakership bid 

chip roy refused to say why he voted present
 of emmer trump said i think hes my biggest fan now because he called me yesterday and told me im your biggest fan

 trump downplayed even derided emmer the thirdranking house republican with whom he has had rocky relationship while presenting himself as a kingmaker who talks to a lot of congressmen seeking his stamp of approval

 theres only one person who can do it all the way jesus christ he declared

trump has further lost his damn mind imagine supporting someone just because they called to stroke your ego not to mention the jesus christ reference 

also emmer can go fuck himself with a rusty rake hes just as bad as mccarthy and jordan
trump not happy with emmer calling him a rino

httpstruthsocialcomrealdonaldtrumpposts111291340230348905
at this rate the government will definitely be shutting down in the next few weeks
trump hasnt picked a winner in a major race in a loooong time maybe they ought not look towards him for endorsement
jakesherman on twitter

new  emmer just briskly walked out of the longworth house office building 

the meeting is ongoing and hes gone

man were really going submooch

a scalise was 1 day

now weve got an emmer which is a few hours
where the fuck did they all go

recess after doing what
id like to submit my dog tasha for consideration as speaker shes an independent willing to work with both sides of the aisle shell make deals for belly rubs or a tortilla chip
they need to find q and nominate him
rep marjorie taylor greene said she likes rep tom emmer but she was never going to support him for speaker because of his political positions including a critical vote to certify the 2020 election 

she said emmers vote to certify the 2020 election played a big role in her decision not to support him i couldnt support a speaker of the house that didnt object 

greene said emmers short lived candidacy is a sign that the conference is shifting 

the gop conference is changing and its changing to reflect america first and republican voters overwhelmingly support president donald trump and the gop conference and the speaker of the house should do the same she said
all remaining speaker candidates voted against certifying the 2020 election ugh
republican members of the house who believe in our republic as set forth in the constitution by our founding fathers who believe in federalism to even a basic degree and the union of our states and who believe americans deserve a functioning government need to look around their caucus and realize that democrats are not their enemy their enemy is the members of the house so beholden to those who seek chaos corruption and ruin of our country in order to replace our government with one only responsive to the interests of the wealthiest people in the world

their goal is not to make government work they exist only to exercise their power in order to burn it all down they will never negotiate in good faith because they dont share your goals and arent interested in solving the problem 

it is not democrats who are the enemy and youre going to have to rise to this occasion face your true enemy and defeat them as a united house republicans and democrats working together to reject these attempts to undermine our country
when do we start using the term constitutional crisis to describe this is there any constitutional remedy any actions by the other body by the other branches what happens if the first two executives are incapacitated does the secretary of education take over
the party of originalist construction is now floating a plan to haveva deputy speaker which is neither mentioned nor implied in the constitution 

these guys are such fucking assholes
why not just go with george santos  he was already speaker from 19361945 and did that while being the man that won wwii for the allies  i know hes currently coaching the chiefs as well and investigating the kidnapping of 15 of his nieces but this is a man that can multitask
i lived in tom emmers district for a year for college not a shining example of an ideal district st cloud is one of the worst cities in minnesota on almost every level he doesnt give a shit and he knows hell be forever reelected really bad dude
man i cant wait for emmer to not even get 217 votes after having to go for 5 elimination rounds to win the nominee after the guy who last won the nominee couldnt get 217 after the last nominee didnt even bring it to the floor because he couldnt get 217 votes after the last speaker who only got speaker after 15 rounds of votes got ousted by 8 republicans
so in the current state of things what do you all think are the odds of

 emmer gets in with no dem support
 emmer gets in with dem support
 mccarthy gets in for a limited term
 trump gets in for a limited term
 we blow the shutdown deadline without electing a speaker
 other options
wapo changed their livestream to 3 pm
apparently trumps camp is whipping up votes against emmer hes not getting it
must suck to have your whole party at the whim of an emotionally unstable mentally unsound utterly selfcentered conman because your voting bloc is completely brainwashed to only view said conman as the correct figure

have to go along with him in everything otherwise youre excommunicated by the religion
 lets get our poop in a group people


dont think thats how it goes
so weve gone through the house majority leader  the house whip both of whom should have strong consensus in the party but neither have been accepted

not a great look
lmao holy shit dropped before even a floor vote

their gonna nominate the entire caucuso ne by one at this rate
how can anyone even identify as a republican anymore after watching this skit lol my first grade class would be able to get their shit together faster than these pitiful excuses for representatives just pathetic
i come back from lunch and bro has dropped out lmao
abc news is saying meadows has been granted immunity

edit wrong thread but ill leave it
the house that trump built
were this much closer to speaker george santos   assuming they dont hold the vote for one of the days hell be pitching in the world series
manu raju is the man mad props for his doggedness
when emmer walked out early i hope it was straight to hakeem jeffries office
damn son how much do you hate your conference that youre voting present on an openended secret ballot literally the only reason to do this is if you think everyone in the room including yourself is incapable of leading
apparently there are like 3040 holdouts on this johnson
mike johnson

voted to steal the 2020 election and disenfranchise millions of american voters

wants to ban abortion nationwide

opposes the legalization of samesex marriage

supports trumps muslim ban

opposes marijuana legalization

conversely he said this about pelosi

were going to try to work with democratsnancy pelosiis a very kind and generous person shes been great to me

httpstwittercompatriottakesstatus1717006145833804105
someone like don bacon who was ready to basically fist fight jim jordan is seemingly aok with johnson i think they finally have their guy

someone who tried to steal 2020 and will have no qualms trying to also steal 2024
so for now they have a nominee johnson who did even worse than emmer on their little test vote and is a lot less pallatable for anyone thats not maga but they still want to take him to the floor in about 5 hours why 

dont get me wrong i love me some cspan and chill as much as the next guy but this sounds like the definition of insanity to me
george santos hasnt seen turnover for a position like this since hogwarts where he was headmaster and had to keep hiring new professors for the defense against the dark arts class
more breaking news mark meadows granted immunity for testimony with jack smiths grand jury testified that he repeatedly told trump that he lost 2020 election 

carry on
the only thing i know for sure is that the government is 100 shutting down next month holy shit

if emmer was any good at his job we would have resolved this 19 days ago the whip is literally in charge of getting votes
house rs are on a break until 4 pm

look at the list of gop holdouts a lot of toughtomove republicans

conventional wisdom in the leadership is you cant go to the floor and expect to win unless youre within 10

httpsxcomjakeshermanstatus1716877122533491190s20
this shit aint happening today its scalise all over again
emmer has 26 no votes this is hilarious 
its getting to the point where all republicans are going to be rinos because they havent brought guns onto the floor of the house to shoot all others not like them
if the delay isnt emmer reaching out to democrats and making concessions this is pointless
thats when it gets a little scary 

mario diaz balart on if emmer cant get 217 votes 



sounds like one of those sports quotes memes
hey republicans

dont get me wrong i still find this very funny your inability to get a speaker from your own party but cmon

why are you guys so fucking pathetic either get your shit together or let the adults take over and then you can whine about how bad they are without embarrassing yourselves more than is needed here
i hope dems can use all this idiocy from maga to win more in va and elsewhere in two weeks
maybe they can do a march madness style one on one basketball tourney to select the speaker we can all make brackets
 that strategy caused deep frustration with republicans privately and publicly lambasting the ohio republican for playing hardball without an endgame strategy


isnt that what the hard righters do charge in like leeroy jenkins
they just need to start having votes and keep voting till they have a speaker
so were never getting a new speaker got it
now some of them say emmer should drop out and  kevin hearn or mike johnson have a shot of it       
latest cnn update
emmers needs to cut a deal with the dems then exact cold blooded relentless retribution on the freedom caucus 

no committee assignments no floor time no recognition to speak no office no staff no budget no campaign funds

the gop has to put their mad dogs down

gop lawmaker says he expects there will another speakers race

thats some bold predicting  definitely see why the gop isnt a complete shit show right now with nostradumbasses at the helm 
 i believe they also expect the sun will rise tomorrow morning
i would be too embarrassed to attend another candidate forum
hern is out again endorsing mike johnsonhttpstwittercomthehillstatus1716945531849855271s20
something so funny about the idea of kevin mccarthy coming in as the inspiring elder statesman to save the house gop from itself the man is a fucking moron from bakersfield who can barely get out the gop talking points without falling on his face or making a ridiculously stupid gaffe a milquetoast nothing of a figure with no ideology or belief system the absolute definition of empty suit and this is the great savior of the house republicans l o fucking l
didnt the democrats get more congressional votes than republicans in the last election it is only through gerrymandering that the gop holds a slight majority it pisses me off that gop congresspeople are allowed to say in the msm that the american people gave the gop the leadership and the interviewer never calls them out on the fact that they rigged the system and still only barely have a majority

what the american people want is compromises to two be reached for any gop speaker to easily win promise the democrats a vote avoiding a government shutdown and funding for ukraine and maybe a few other bills put for a vote
people here need to temper expectations and think logicallyrepublicans rather continue this charade for an eternity instead of picking a candidate that makes concessions to dems 

jeffries will not be speaker and neither will a moderate r they will pick someone that appeases both bases in their party
meadows flipped on trump in the dc election case

4 flips in the ga case

well if tom emmer does go to the floor for a vote they are still some people that will not vote  for him

 httpstwittercomtherecountstatus1716833953317834769
so considering emmer voted to certify the election in 2020 there is no way he has 217 is there
spoiler alert they suck and fail to unite to elect a speaker

im going to save this as a shortcut copypaste thing
there is a lot of damage that has already been done by mccarthy and his giving the freedom caucus greater power even if emmer becomes speaker with the help of democrats there remains a dysfunctional house majority

among other things i wonder what happens to the motion to vacate rule 

if that remains in place  then at some point in the near future its simply going to be as yogi berra once said déjà vu all over again
day 24 lets give it up for day 24httpsmediatenorcom6lzr_a1uap8aaaacspongebobsquarepantsmrkrabsgif
fucking knew it this bloc is going to continue to be a thorn in whoever the nominees side they will repeatedly nominate jordan or donalds if hes not their guy meanwhile theres a bloc that will repeatedly nominate existing leadership mccarthyscalisenow emmer

there is no way past this impasse without expelling hardliners or ds voting present with some special conditions for the r nominee
have they tried blaming dominion machines for the failed vote results  someone should just use the general election script and doubt the results of the vote claim it was stolen and that they in fact did secure enough votes to win throw hugo chavez in there
republicans are so small government that they dont believe in having a functioning government at all
deleted
anyone know what trump meant when he wrote that emmer

actually spent more time defending ilhan omar than he did me


not that trump ever tells the truth but whats that about
there are a lot people in here that dont have a very good understanding of how the house works and it shows
 emmer can only afford to lose four republicans and 26 voted against him behind closed doors he voted to certify the 2020 election voted to keep the government open for 47 days voted for the bipartisan law to avoid a debt default and voted to codify samesex marriage  all issues that members of the hardright have cited

from cnn just a few minutes ago
at this point there is no way we get a speaker unless the gop is willing to work with dems theyre too fractured
emmer has dropped out per cnn wow
so basically any moderate gop cant even get a floor vote and any maga gop cant get over the line
every republican congressperson needs to resign immediately this is ridiculous
republicans are living through trump terrorizing them but still yet are not going to hesitate to vote for him again absolute insanity
at this point im waiting for them to go in for conference the doors close hours pass

doors open the lights turn on and theres bodies on the floor and its like clue house republicans and they start blaming democrats
im fully expecting soon for gaetz to parade around the house waving piggys glasses shouting they give him the authority to lead
i knew emmer would embarrass minnesota in some way but i didnt expect it to be done that quickly  michelle bachmans district is alive and well
this would be funny if this wasnt played out in real life
any historians want to chime in on if this is the biggest cluster fuck that has ever happened in the house  i know that this is the longest we have gone without a speaker but is this a historical fuckfest or is there precedent
if youre a republican how can you look at this debacle and not be just humiliated
lol  i bet if they used ranked choice voting it would solve the problem course theyre too dumb to actually do that so here we go again
one thing is certain if congress ever functions again we need a law establishing a time limit on the majority partys effort to name a house speaker there is no way in hell so few with so little interest in governance should be allowed to destroy the nation like this
httpsxcomjakeshermanstatus1716936383657656762s46to1ohnby0vywjgb4hdzsmxq

these people are crazy
reminder these people are getting paid to do nothing if republican voters really want the fat trimmed they can start with their elected officials
i believe the term for what they are doing to their nominees is gopfensestration
lol conference is voting now

as best i can tell from coverage mccarthy jordan and a the bastardized speakership are the options

theyre fully intent on bringing the speaker nominee to a vote at 9 am tomorrow
either no speaker until next year or we get mccarthy again who even wants the  job at this point
theres something kind of funny about how impossible it is for the gop to function because they are all such terrible people who hate each otherwell if it wasnt for you know the whole stateofthecountry thing
true final ballot

johnson  128 winner

mccarthy  43

donalds  29

jordan  1


it should be noted that jordan and mccarthy were not running
maybe the gop could come up with a deal where they have a rotation of a new speaker every day 

imagine boeberts day would be the day to reach across the aisle s
its certainly possible that johnson gets the votes i had expected jordan to since historically the defining characteristic of republican moderates is the lack of a spine but johnson may be slightly less toxic due to his extremely low name recognition and no obvious scandals tied to him 

his press conference was also very much committed to basically not saying anything that could be used against him orchestrating the 2020 plot get the crazies to boo the reporter while you just smile asking about israel or ukraine aid were not doing policy tonight hes going to strike while the iron is hot tomorrow at noon before anyone has a chance to get any momentum against him 

it sounds like there were no hard objections to him in the conference but at least 20 absences we dont know who but if its people fed up with the crazies torpedoing normal candidates he could still be well short the objectively funniest outcome would be the 20 absentee reps not voting and jeffries backing into the speaker role at least for a moment before the motion to vacate
so basically republicans at this point cant nominate anyone moderate cause the party would murder them before the vote in the house at the same moment the cant nominate anyone close to trump cause the house would murder them during the vote  
and now they have johnson who wants to end aid to ukraine what a great time to be a conservative in the us

fucking clownshow hope theres a miracle in the end of the tunnel and miracles name is hakeem
reminder that seeking trumps endorsement means you hate america
i really think mccarthy is only one shameless enough to deal with the crazies that the gop has and also moderate enough to not lose the purple seats just by existing

strange conunumdrum the gop has right now
this is the vote that never ends

yes it goes on and on my friends

republicans started fucking around not knowing what it was

and theyll continue finding out forever just because
mike garcia of california tells reporters that 20 members voted against emmer and that five voted present in the roll now holdouts are discussing what they want and any grievances with emmer

better than jordan but jordan also didnt get remotely close to 217

continue to shit the bed at the house puts yourself at risk of voters not voting for you next year



compromise with the 212 democrats as opposed to the 20 something never compromise republicans puts yourself at risk of republican voters not voting for you next year


republicans when realized they have created selfeating leopards pikachufacepng
well it looks like trump is not endorsing him so maybe that means hes a good choice lol

i think this might kill toms chances unless democrats get on board

i have many wonderful friends wanting to be speaker of the house and some are truly great warriors rino tom emmer who i do not know well is not one of them he never respected the power of a trump endorsement or the breadth and scope of magamake america great again he fought me all the way and actually spent more time defending ilhan omar than he did mehe is totally outoftouch with republican voters i believe he has now learned his lesson because he is saying that he is protrump all the way but who can ever be sure has he only changed because thats what it takes to win the republican party cannot take that chance because thats not where the america first voters are voting for a globalist rino like tom emmer would be a tragic mistake
 i dont want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something i dont understand said rep bill huizenga rmich a man would have to put his soul at hazard hed have to say ok ill be part of this world

whats the point of the republican party anymore they have no longer have a grounding philosophy that unites them being antidemocrat is not enough to build a party around

at least libertarians have a coherent vision for how they would govern and what government should look like i dont agree with it but i can articulate it 

seriously something else needs to take the gops place
at this point i think itd be easier to flip 610 republicans to vote for jeffries by plying their districts with appropriations
good god now emmer is out who the hell are the gop expecting to be their speaker because theyre running out of candidates and scaring those who do try and step up if scalise and emmer mean anything
deleted
this is a true shit show but part of me enjoys it too much
this would be hilarious if it werent for the fact that we cant do any business without a speaker
i honestly think its all just absurdly hilarious at this point but then again im not an air traffic controller
there is only one way this ends with the moderates bending the knee to the maga caucus jim jordan was too much for them but now they are realizing that the freedom caucus will let this go on forever
what an absolute joke
all 6 new new new candidates for speaker are southern evangelicals and election deniers
shutdown which trump is facilitating means no aid to ukraine which favors putin so this might go on and on and on or until the next world war breaks out whichever comes first
i nominate lauren boebert as spanker of the house
if there were any actual leaders in the republican house theyd have stepped up by now and suggested the way forward  

seems their choice is simple align with the crazy right or with the dems they should get clear on that and then go back to work
i wonder if this is how it felt when the whigs fell apart the inherent contradictions and unstable alliances that propped up the monstrosity that was the current republican party have finally reached their breaking point thanks trump and the party is collapsing like the house of cards it has been for at least the last three decades as political junkies we should be excited by what were witnessing you dont often get to see the full blown collapse of a major political party and a reorientation of the entire party system that said as americans living in the 21st century we should probably not be all that excited by what we are witnessing
im the assistant speaker of the house jordan here is actually the assistant to the speaker of the house

anyone noticing a pattern
so this whole anyone can be named speaker of the house deal i got a question is it really anyone

like could they theoretically make vladimir putin the house speaker or some random woman from trinidad

what about someone on death row like that boston bomber guy could he become speaker

is there an age limit could my 10yearold nephew be made the next house speaker

do they have to be alive could ronald reagan be made speaker

do they have to be human could marjorie taylor greene my cat be named speaker
you could probably put a group of kindergartners in a room and they could do a better job picking a class president
for what its worth tom emmer represents michelle bachmanns old district
at this point i would rather they pick a sophisticated algorithm that just assigns reps to committees based on their profiles and calculates votes
cohen popping up to remind us that he flipped on trump before flipping on trump became cool
breaking reptroynehls if we take emmers name to the floor he knows and just about everyone knows i will be nominating donald j trump as speaker

the 20 republicans who arent yes on emmer are busy trying to figure out how to get to know no emmer   

some will cite ideology some will cite a personal slight real or imaginary some will lean on their contrarian instincts and cite their principles or gut or faith theyll map their path but theyve likely already decided where they wanna be at
clownshow is underselling it this is a verifiable circus of fuckup
god its so beautiful minus the fact that our gov is so fucked 

sometimes i wish dems would just go rogue and start legislating without republicans 

s before constitutionalists snap at me
 from cnn this is an exercise that were very comfortable with the pennsylvania republican said of the whipping process which emmer and reschenthaler have done for every floor vote this congress 


comfortable with just not very good at considering how all those floor votes went
in some totally shocking news emmers bid to become speaker is on verge of collapse
after they go through the entire gop party and still fail to secure a speaker will they just start back over with mccarthy
ha trump just dumped on emmer so that whole exercise was pointless maybe thats the point need 6 reasonable human beings to emerge from the quagmire that is the gop reject the trump wing trying to destroy your party and vote with dems thats actually probably what trump wants at this point  they should too honestly then they dont have to pretend like they have a clue what theyre doing and can go back to airing grievances and screaming about culture war bullshit
27 confirmed republicans opposed to emmer on the floor this will genuinely never get resolved
these guys are such a joke cant even elect a speaker how do they expect us to think they can actually accomplish anything after that gov is def shutting down in a few weeks
emmer is finished      
trump outside a newyork courtroom             
lol
at least scalise lasted a day lmaoo
moderate republicans really have just two options at this point if they really have any interest in having a speaker again before 2025 1 work with the freedumb caucus or 2 work with the democrats 

no actual party with any unifying interests has full control of the house and we know that maga is never going to work with democrats
soon well be seeing speaker nominees for nanomooches
lol lmao lmfao even 

the republican party is in complete disarray
republican led government is not the solution to our problems

republican led government is the problem
at this point i am hoping to see 5 or so republicans get so upset they leave the party and become independents costing the gop the majority
at this point every time i see a new speaker candidate nominated i feel like i should buy a cup of coffee and see if its still warm by the time they drop out
mccarthys 15 rounds of voting was more fun this is just sad
how is rconservative doing these days i feel a bit optimistic and in a good mood and really dont want to ruin it by checking up on them
gop ok who wants to get in the clown car now
i want to see some vegas odds on this can we parlay how many mooches a nominee will last or rounds they will lose in

edit as pointed out mooches is too long of a time frame using emmers 4hrs as a time unit now
so weve determined that republicans who voted against the 2020 presidential election certification are too divisive to become speaker eg jordan but also republicans who voted for it are being torpedoed by the trump camp eg emmer

there are only three other possibilities a someone not in congress unlikely b a freshman republican congressman probably less likely or c someone who came back to congress in 2023 after an absence

ladies and gentlemen may i present speaker ryan zinke

kise alleged that attorney general letitia james knew about the risk at least as of last wednesday but there was no mention of it he said the court was not notified until saturday and said four ag team members have tested positive 

another trump attorney also confirmed a member of the former presidents team tested positive 

judge arthur engoron said court will proceed and commented i understand what youre saying i understand your concerns he added that masks are available

hahahaha the judge told them to put on masks of course they wont but thats hilarious
everyone saying the dems should make a deal

no they shouldnt 

this is on the rs let them flail it is not the responsibility of the dems to rescue the repubs party simply because they are unable to govern rs would not help if roles were reversed they would be on prime time running ads about how dysfunctional ds are and laughing all the way to the election
interesting how gaetz has no problem with emmer or literally anyone else literally decided to blow up the house all because of a personal vendetta against mccarthy what a petulant child
for those who think tom emmer is a moderate he voted with trumps position 91 of the time fired a gun that said firepelosi and is staunchly anti abortion

honestly the longer this drags on the more respect i have for kevin mccarthy for even lasting 8 months
gop majority whip tom emmer drops speaker bid after four hours httpswwwtheindependentcomnewsworldamericasuspoliticshousespeakernomineetomemmerb2435367html
the chief of staff

if theres one guy you never ever want to testify against you its the chief of staff they know where the bodies are buried they may have helped bury them

literally anyone else working with the prosecutors would be better
the big lie  grift continues

according to meadows book the election was stolen and rigged with help from allies in the liberal media who ignored actual evidence of fraud right there in plain sight for anyone to access and analyze

but as described to abc news meadows privately told smiths investigators that  to this day  he has yet to see any evidence of fraud that would have kept nowpresident joe biden from the white house and he told them he agrees with a government assessment at the time that the 2020 presidential election was the most secure election in us history
sen tim scott rsc pitched newt gingrich as a possible candidate for house speaker

how bout no

fun fact mike johnson a few years ago claimed he had adopted an african american child who just so happened to think that black people shouldnt get reparations an african american adopted child who is not mentioned in his house bio or any documents whatsoever not even a picture of them
looks like its taking them 20 minutes per round

so we should have round 4 results in about 10  minutes
people like him because hed put to vote a bill to support ukraine which is probably the only bipartisan legislation that will get passed at this point under any republican speaker in fairness to his 2007 statement of marriage between a man and a woman obama literally said the same thing at the time gay marriage was not a popular opinion at the time more recently he did vote in favor of the respect for marriage act 

reading his history i did get a laugh out of him supporting an amendment to allow minnesota to nullify federal law though are we back in the 1830s
crazy enough thats still pretty moderate compared to the rest of his party
this is just regular gop crazy now there are no republicans left in the house a few in the senate that are less crazy than this
the most moderate  
  
jfc
dont forget what he said right after that

i hope we can find a different choice banks said adding tom emmers not a conservative

apparently the bar for conservative is really high now lol
one wonders if the idea that dems might be willing to work with emmer is enough to kill his nomination right there
the danger for emmer in this scenario is if he doesnt then the rules still allow him to be removed by a single vote and if he got the seat with democratic support he will promptly lose it without it especially because he would have had to have taken their help in the first place
that escalated quickly
id be pissed if i just finished writing and submitting this detailed article on who he is only to find the article irrelevant four minutes later lol
there are no moderate republicans emmer is just one of the least farright
he signed on to the scotus brief to overturn the election he aint a moderate
dont think anyone actually considers him a legitimate moderate just that hes probably as close as you could get to being almost a reasonable house republican at this point considering that he voted to certify the election even though he also put his name on the petition to the scotus to election challenges and he also voted to protect marriage rights for same sex and interracial marriages

let the republicans continue to fight though and have this stuff come out as the reason why they are against him being speaker it wont go over well for them in 12 months
its probably their best way out of this mess

they change it jeffries becomes speaker and they get to blame it on crenshaw while returning to what they do best as a party shoving shitty doa bills onto the desk of democratic speakers
deleted
i remember when michell bachmann his predecessor was embarrassing minnesota with her crazy tea party ways  now she seems relatively normal
virginian here the state fucked itself with youngkin because of voter apathy in 2020 we had a turn out of 448 million in 2021 it was 321 million thats almost a third less voters i guess 2020 was the election to end all elections last years turn out was even worse so i fully expect this year to be just as bad and then people who didnt vote are going to whine that virginia is going backwards
it will be etched in summer snow neverremember
about as much chance as someone calling me today and offering up 100k just because they like me
i also chose your mom
its kind of amazing to consider the mindset that lets you say we want you to vote for our guy because we refuse to vote for your guy with a straight face especially with the background that emmer won the conference nomination in the first place
this is honestly the best solution ive heard yet but because its such a good idea i doubt theyll actually do this
lol lmao even

oh  lets spoil ourselves its lmfao
only 0011 mooches
the house shall chuse a speaker and if it cant i dont know some kind of speaker and assistant speaker deal does this really need to be written out christ i need a drink

james madison
assistant to the speaker
assistant to the speaker
assistant to the speaker
it means we really shouldnt have done this in the first place but at least the 8 can save face by pretending that they changed something
mccarthy its those 8 members and all the democrats who caused this mess by kicking me out

reporters who gave them the ability for a single person in your caucus to initiate the vote

mccarthy shocked pikachu face
 no one believes that and blames democrats luckily it even seems republicans realize that

like even my mom who watches fox all day recognizes this as republican dysfunction
theres zero chance donald trump shows up and does that job he is lazy and uninterested in doing actual work executive time was him sleeping off last nights binge of adderall kfc and tweeting
this would literally be worse  the judges arent going to just let him nope out of his criminal proceedings because he happened to be voted speaker  less than nothing will get done in the house
nehls has been achinghttpsoldredditcomrpoliticscomments175kmqcdiscussion_thread_second_house_speaker_electionk4gb8as to be allowed to vote trump for speakerhttpsoldredditcomrpoliticscomments176ey0rrace_for_speaker_of_the_house_slides_intok4lqdpt since this whole thing began
why would biden have to adjust his golf schedule
mccarthy is trying apparently
mccarthy surprised pikachu at dems letting republicans implode
hoo boy thats a game of chicken i want to watch

wild that the idea of burning it all down is more appealing than making concessions and working with democrats
fox floated this idea last week  this is spicy  republicans are playing with fire whilst both holding the gas and the match standing over a gas soaked field of dried grass
i dont think crenshaw is an inner circle guy in either the ultraconservative camp or the mccarthy camp so while interesting this probably doesnt get a lot of traction
his public display of dick pics while the house is in session are also shockingly infrequent
its sad that being against marriage equality is language to connect with a base of voters
reach across the isle to republicans and theyll shit in your hand point and laugh and make fun of you for smelling like shit
this is the problem they have a razor thin margin and there will always be that many republicans willing to be contrarians
it actually simplifies it  since he knows he doesnt have the votes in caucus and knows no one is likely to get them  then he can move onto plan b and that is to start negotiating with democrats as his next move
they should have asked him how many rs voted for pelosi
he more or less did that minus the look at previous decades in his first and second oval office addresses this year
same here i caught up on all the news went into a meeting for 1 hour and when i came out they were back to square one
cpac flat out kicked the log cabin gay republicans from its gathering texas gop party made being antigay a major platform in its mission statement too 

gop needs a minority group to scapegoat last 23 years they thought they could ramp up antilgbtq sentiments worked for their base but not much else they only recently started to back off from it as a result not because they grew some morality or decency they just decided this scapegoat wasnt given them the returns they wanted
deleted
going mask off its the death of euphemism a phase of fascism
dogs that caught the car
he voted to certify he voted to codify same sex marriage and trump is against him

three strikes down swinging idk if they can even get his candidacy to the floor
like crenshaw said a few weeks ago if you hold a grudge against election denial there will be no one left to work with   


its shameful
its pretty sad that emmer in that regard was our second best option from those running  only two voted to certify the election emmer among them but he also supported the texas lawsuit to overturn the results so  yeah
i hit myself in the face so many times that it doesnt hurt anymore
the single largest display of republican incompetence in your life so far
wait until they reelect mccarthy as speaker and all this was for nothing
thats certainly what they claim is happening literally every time theres bad news for the right and a post about it becomes popular over there
i am betting the downvoted gaetz is right purge the rinos trump for speaker comments are more accurate than you would be lead to believe in there most gop voters shitpost on facebook groups not reddit
you bring up a great point 

the israeli conflict has been slowly widening israel just targeted some syrian army mortars in the last hour

were on the precipice of a regional war in the middle east and were getting this joke of a possible joint speakership
way worse than just voting to overturn the election  he was the architect

in formal statements justifying their votes about threequarters relied on the arguments of a lowprofile louisiana congressman representative mike johnson the most important architect of the electoral college objections
now now we all know thats too complicated for them
ranked choice requires them to compromise
as the current majority whip he definitely should know better
probably counting on enough dems to missing to lower the threshold and getting enough rs to fall in line
yeah he did and on a day when a third lawyer from his georgia rico case plead guilty as well he truly deserves every vote he has asked his constituents not to deliver
ill believe it when i see it
im not a betting man but
im surprised fox isnt just lying to their viewers that republicans have had a speaker this entire time at this point half of them would believe it
no because on the big wheel someone will win no later than the 3rd spin

its like when the contestants keep overbidding on the same item and bob barker just gets angrier and angrier as they keep missing it and no one will just bid a dollar to win it
it seems like there are only two possible outcomes  establishment gop surrenders to maga or establishment gop reopens the house in conjunction with democratic support

democrats are not going to support a gop speaker for free and nor should they  but i do think its worth trying to reach a deal here to keep the government stable through the rest of bidens term
huhhhh has he already withdrawn
to be fair that majority whip was terrible at their job  like just bad  so it actually tracks
74 million voted for trump in 2020 i know a few who voted for trump in 2016 and i could rationalize their vote in that they wanted an outsider as opposed to a seasoned insider i cannot fathom what motivated 74 million to vote for the idiot in 2020
a schrödingers speaker if you will
starting to think they are now getting scared of bringing a vote to the floor and risking the chance of a couple republicans defecting to jeffries
gop is trading the embarrassment of failed votes happening for the embarrassment of days without a speaker

mccarthy took 15 votes gop i guess feels taking 20 days to get out fewer failed votes is a win for them not sure about that
deleted
air bud 6 retriever of the house
he was definitely mad he had a whole take back the house event planned for night of the election and it didnt pan out the fact that it took a few days to call the house was irritating i bet
george santos will be the last one standing
to put the numbers to any future people looking back on this thread at the time of standamans commenting this discussion thread the digital equivalent of lettuce is only 9 hours old and has lasted longer in this world than speakernominee emmer
trumps words may be just noise to us but in the crazy world house rs live in they have weight devastating for emmer
 he never respected the power of a trump endorsement

worked great for jordan
what an asshole  i still cant believe this guy was a president furthermore i cant believe hes still a candidate for president again
theyll probably lose the house and take the senate
no one the speaker invites the president hed have to do it from the oval
mchenry i guess
please clap
those are still here and those people are still rampaging across school districts all over the country
want to know where the kitty litter thing came from someone suggested sand in a bucket as an emergency bathroom during school lockdowns kitty litter in the classrooms was a diversion from their unwillingness to address gun violence in schools
then you dont understand the gop
its not about the destination

its about the journey 
nah  maga land would call that bluff any day and counter work with democrats and well primary your ass and then there will be more of us
 rep jim banks of indiana called emmer the single most liberal member of republican leadership

lmfao
if emmer is the most liberal republican there is then bipartisanship was never an option for anything
not sure average citizen even knows what a speaker of the house is
santos cant be speaker right now he is currently getting ready to race at las vegas grand prix

silly you
it was the district that elected michele bachmann which says a lot about that district
theyre calling this guy that votes like 95 the same as a freedumb caucuser a rino lmaoo
i think its assistant to the speaker
assistant to the trailer park supervisor
im the assistant manager of this chamber i sell sedition and sedition accessories
the last time gym jordan was an assistant 300 students got molested this time everyone gets fucked
in short jordan will be calling the shots and mccarthy will have the title thats where this is going
this is genuinely hilarious and absolutely not gonna happen either
aaron burr for speaker of the house
overheard in gop cloak room after ballot 5
he got me emmer said of trumps dunk over him that fing trump boomed me
emmer added hes so good repeating it four times
emmer then said he wanted to add trump to the list of speaker nominees he cofailed to reach 218 floor votes with
maybe sometime around january 2025
lol lets give a shot to the people that lost to emmer surely that will unify us lmao theyre so delusional
its a moronic argument  if emmer doesnt work out theyve tried the obvious choice in scalise a hardline conservative in jordan and now a perceived moderate in emmer  if this doesnt work out they may need to consider getting some democrat support  or dems may make a play to get jeffries in there but thats less likely
rinse and repeat no one in the conference can get enough votes
i think its hilarious how they are supposedly limiting the speeches to 1 minute why even fucking have speeches at this point what is there to fucking say in a closed door jerk off session
so fun that interracial marriages are on the table for things to axe
i saw one republican say he could never support emmer because he voted in favor of same sex marriage soyea hes got an uphill battle
yeah hes doa among the republicans
 among other things i wonder what happens to the motion to vacate rule


i am going to laugh my ass off if the first action the house does after whoever is speaker is a vote to vacate by gaetz
i think half the countrys reps walking out to go fight a civil war against the federal government is probably the biggest cluster fuck that has ever happened

edit on a more serious note the longest election for speaker was in 1856 when it took 133 votes and 2 months to elect a speaker this was mainly because the pro and anti slavery factions clashed and neither side could get a majority vote
because you have to be able to feel shame to feel humiliated
thats functionally what they are using for the secret ballots to determine the speaker nominee the lowest rank gets removed and they revote with the remaining candidates
she didnt reach across the aisle just over the armrest
he never respected the power of a trump endorsement

dont most of the people trump endorses lose badly
waht you yoo meann it looks nrmoal t m
the tweet is a screenshot of a past trump endorsement of emmer for those who would rather not click
you can say that again
israelgazas whole thing is a tougher sell for the gops voter base being unable to intervene in that in a lot of ways is going to aggravate their evangelicals
yes let chatgpt be the house speaker
every time something big goes down i head over there to see their reaction to it their front page is usually just stories about highschool trans athletes whenever something actually important is happening
my new favorite from over there im so sick of this reality tv politics that sprang up with obama especially since our side is so terrible at it  
  
yep obama thats who brought in the reality tv politics
frothing at the mouth any time someone suggests working with democrats funding for ukraine or trump being guilty of anything but loving puppies
somewhere between wow this is so embarrassing im starting to hate republicans more than democrats and good the uniparty keeps losing 

total shit show they deserve the gop
they seem to be the same bunch of idiots they always were not likely to ever change
there is 0 chance republicans would vote for jesus if they didnt know he was jesus
are there absolutely no normal gopers left  they all seem to be so insanely extreme
the next speaker will either have the freedom caucus holding his nuts or the democrats  id rather it be the democrats
i think he is getting tons of blowback i think gaetz honestly thought the dems would save mccarthy and didnt even think mccarthy would get ousted lol
91 for a gop rep is on the low side of the caucus  sinema and manchin have voted with bidens preferred position iirc in the high 80s  low 90s
and after emmer went groveling to him and said he was trumps biggest fan yesterday what an absolute cuck
welp thats that

have fun gop you own this shit it ends when you want it to
welp it wont be emmer then

trump isnt strong enough to make a speaker but he can sink one
really where the respect should be going is nancy pelosi  she actually passed a shit ton of stuff on a thin majority
it was enough to kill the idea of giving interim speaker mchenry enough power to bring legislation to the floor
and trump just opened his face flaps and called emmer a rino  for some reason hes trying pretty hard to sink emmer which is odd since he was one of trumps earliest and biggest cheerleaders in mn in 20152016
hell i like you and ill offer you 500k

i dont have it but it seems like a nice offer to make
the conservative sub seems pretty upset at their party

didnt see much blaming of dems there which is surprising honestly
and the media will be like both parties were involved in a hand shitting situation on the hill today
yes he withdrew about a quarteremmer ago
yeah losing the senate has always been more likely than not but honestly i am becoming a bit more bullish on a 5050 senate with vp tie breaker
they dont most republicans i know think the president controls every aspect of their lives and eyes start spinning when you say free market
assistant to the regional speaker
i dont get this they all crawl to him and thank him for pissing on them its crazy how spineless they are
these cucks are so infuriating
theres a few sprinkled about but they seem to be vastly outnumbered even in rconservative everyone that i know irl that is conservative is blaming this squarely on republicans and republicans alone not that itll make them change their votes to dems though "

jake tapper now i recognize congressman jordan isnt necessarily someone who respects election results   lolol
a source describes the jordan meeting with the holdouts like this a direct precise meeting in which jordan was told he will never be speaker this group doesnt want anything they want jordan to understand he will not be speaker

jake sherman
manu raju with a series of tweets

 opposition expects they will increase to 29 today
 members pissed that gym is talking about holding them here during the weekend
 with one fewer jordan voter present a dude went to israel to get away from this mess gym can now only lose 3 votes

jeffries voting for himself to wild applause followed by jordan voting for himself and getting half the applause mixed with boos was pretty funny
jeffries is just here to pad his total votes for speaker record
httpstwittercomjakeshermanstatus1715363245123400085

in the meeting yesterday between jim jordan and hold outs close jordan ally warren davidson said its not team jordans fault that holdouts are getting death threats they are getting the death threats he said because they voted against jordan

this was relayed to me from many ppl in the room
sidebar kenneth chesebro is pleading guilty in a plea deal in georgia right nowhttpswwwyoutubecomlivefono945_vk0featureshared
at this point someone should nominate the lady calling roll shes the only person in the entire chamber getting any work done
rep troy nehls who has voted for jim jordan in the last three rounds told cnn he will vote for former president donald trump if theres another speaker ballot 

my next vote will be for donald j trump he told cnn

the clown show keeps getting clownier 
new the gaetz 8 have sent a letter to colleagues saying theyre willing to accept whatever punishment  censure getting kicked out of conferencecommittees  if it means holdouts will back jordan basically offering themselves as tribute in lastditch attempt to help jordan

lmao
house holdouts  we dont want anything from jordan except for him to understand that he will never be speaker

good for him
gotta hand it to the hold outs rumor is there are 50 of them but they are slowly adding more to the no side in each vote making it more and more embarrassing for jordan
httpsxcomatruparstatus1715380710935023653s46tukr1tshxveunp4_vn5gzrw

 democrats break out in laughter when mccarthy calls jordan an effective legislator and a compromiser
the gop moaning at the dems just listing gym jordans own voting record is rich
at first i thought that this mess was really funny

but now that the republicans have been in a leadership crisis for three weeks as jordan scalise and mccarthy have all faced public humiliation its still actually really funny
these vote megathreads gonna get me fired lol too much fun refreshing
when i need to take a mental break from israel and gaza i put on a light comedy like the us house of representatives
overnight it sounds like there might have been some movement with the ny republicans but jordan would still be welllll short of what he needs plus with a congressman who left for israel on a fact finding trip who had been voting for gym jordan can now only lose 3 votes

and i have a sneaking suspicion that scott perry calling his colleagues who are receiving death threats pussies might have ruined any goodwill that jordan gained with the ny republicans

he might get a net gain of a couple but i think it is more likely that he loses additional support
more importantly 194 republicans were okay with gym jordan allies offering death threats to colleagues and colleagues spouses and children  


fuck all of them
rconservative is having a meltdown trying to blame dems for this you guys voted these people in
mccarthy stumping for jordan lol what a pussy
mccarthy jim jordan is about compromise and working long hours

everyone lol
heres the thing who is actually leading the republican party trump has no interest in doing it and is currently buried under 90 indictments mcconnell blue screen of deaths every time he gets in front of a camera and the speaker of the house chair is getting colder and colder by the day who is actually leading things sean hannity its pathetic
breaking news trumps other lawyer cheseboro has plead guilty and accepted a plea deal in the fulton ga case
im starting to feel that the story about 55 republicans just fucking with jordan and slowly adding more random votes against him every session may be true lol
jeffries sitting there like hes at a restaurant and the entire wait staff comes over to his table to sing happy birthday

 after the vote was announced that he lost jim jordan stood up and said he accepted the results multiple lawmakers told cnn

 gop rep russell fry told cnn that jordan said he appreciated everyones support throughout the process that that he respected the decision

 just accepting an election l like that  what did you do to the real jim jordan
mccarthy is the reason most hotels have the cuck chair
jeffries

jeffries

jeffries

wild applause
lmfao jeffries getting a standing ovation for voting for himself

edit and then jordan votes for himself and gets a halfassed response from his own people
democrats are voting against jim because jim is an insurrectionist and election denier
hakeem jeffries  introduced passed and enacted bills 11

gymbo  introduced passed and enacted bills zero

he is not an effective legislator mccarthy he is a scumbag bully whose sole purpose is to foment chaos
why would hunter bidens laptop do this to gym jordan
its the night of wronged wives
the year is 2153 the united states is a vassal of the transoceanic empire of bangladesh in the dusty chamber of the house of representatives the pale almost skeletonized body of patrick mchenry  alive it is whispered only by way of necromancy  bangs the gavel to call the house into session demanding that a permanent speaker be chosen so the house can get on with the business of approving the amount of tribute to be sent to dhaka
the whole democrats did this l talking point has real big we lost the championship because the other team didnt let us win mentality
deleted
mccarthy two weeks ago bring it


mccarthy now pls vote for the sexual assault guy because i lost my job to the leopards in my party
for those on cspan chesebro is currently taking a plea on cnn
the republicans are doing their best to blame the current chaos in the house on democrats but the truth is the republicans are in the majority as such it is up to them to select and confirm the speaker of the house  not the minority party there once was a speaker mccarthy but a handful of maga republicans initiated the vote to remove him from that job causing the current chaos the republicans have shown over the more than two weeks that this has been going on that they are unable and unwilling to govern it is the republican party that is divided and splintered and in the grip of the maga extremists not the democrats who are united and the republican impotence is playing out during major world crisiss that demand immediate house action as well as the action required to keep the us government open after november 17th the blame for all of this rests squarely on the side of the republicans and not the democrats
its painfully obvious that the only path forward is for moderate republicans to put forward a pick that the dems can also vote for and completely bypass the freedom caucus
i think the dems are going to let this go on into midnovember until every republican showboat has made a fool of themselves before the country and then theyre going to stand up grab the most moderate republican and say give us money for ukraine and a budget that will pass the senate and well add a line to your resumé

and then watch matt gaetz realize he has lost every bit of influence he had or ever will have
per msnbc 112 republicans told gym gtfo behind closed doors

buncha cowards couldnt do that on the floor thanks for wasting our time
a jordan supporter flew off to israel on a factfinding mission so hes already lost another vote
you dont have the votes ha ha ha ha you dont have the votes
republican no votes

first round 20
second 23
third 25

someone tell jordan this is not how he gets the speakership
why doesnt jordan just publicly claim he won this vote by a lot and try to assume the speakership anyway

s
seems that most independent voters are just republicans that dont want to call themselves one as is the norm
pamela new jersey democract

love the accent she says the republicans shouldnt ask for democrats help democrats never got help for them wants money to go to the middle class and not the rich 

great call
what a humiliating past couple days for jim jordan you love to see it
i havent breathed this big sigh of relief for all of us american people since that saturday morning nov 2020 when biden was announced as presidentelect 

we wont have a compete bonehead who is not a practicing lawyer due to not passing the bar exam a rapistenabler insurrection supporter temper tantrum throwing cant wear a blazer to save his life  third in line to the presidency 

we can celebrate the wackos not winning this one just in time for the weekend
this is such an unbelievable train wreck that everyone but republicans saw coming when mccarthy foolishly agreed to make it so simple to toss a speaker out
i dont know why places such as rconservative is so outraged and shocked over this

gop is the party that campaigns on government being fundamentally broken and gets elected to prove it

what exactly do they want from the gop
republicans in a nutshell

republicans the magas are holding us hostage

americans you cultivated and cheered this on for years

republicans yeah when it was happening to you now their eating us

fin
for a party that claims to be so anticommunism republicans sure enjoy being publicly owned
cheesebro just flipped as jury proceedings began

jordan lost more votes

the gop is fracturing in real time and these two storylines are playing out parallel to each other because of how interconnected they are 

conservative values
im late to the party holy shit mccarthy gave jordans nominating speech for this ballot that cuck has got to have a humiliation fetish
todays scorecard of those who voted against jordan on the 2nd round weve just gavelled in

rep steve womack of arkansas voted for scalise



if the final count is 412 the missing representative is derrick van orden rwi who voted for jordan in both of the first two votes cnn reports he is in israel
did he just make fun of a guy for passing one bill when jim has passed zero
 recess
 closeddoor circle jerk
 fail harder
 repeat
compromise with the 212 democrats nahhh

compromise with the 8 never compromise extremists in your party while alienating 30 moderates in your party thats the republican way
mchenry not wanting the job is an indicator that hed be better than most rs honestly
an elected rep on cspan just said multiple times that hakeem jeffries has denied many election results 

edit i believe it was tim burchett from tennessee
if the democrats want bipartisanship they have to vote for the republican candidate

thats not how it works maga karen
oh shit chesebro plead guilty
i do love seeing republicans fail
lol secret ballot was 12486 to give jordan the boot
ha  did anyone hear rep don bacon low key and unwittingly advocate for ranked choice voting behind closed doors  check it outhttpswwwcspanorgvideoc5089290usercliprepresentativedonbaconunwittinglyadvocatesrankedchoicevotingcloseddoors
why wont obama stop and leave these poor innocent republicans alone
cant believe hunter bidens laptop is doing this to gym
the crazy thing to me is that jordan had an offramp here he could say all right im not the selection due to rinos or whatever yesterday ill wait till january to change peoples minds

surely thats a better call than repeatedly getting your face shoved in the dirt
day 3 of people taking 20 minutes to push a fucking button
non american here first time watching cspan these callers are hilarious is it always like this bunch of nut jobs
mccarthys speech is going to give fact checkers a stroke
how can mccarthy stand up so straight with no spine 

quite a feat
kevins speech is legit going to last longer than it takes for gym to lose 3 votes impressive
this might be a good time to remind people that jim jordan had a net worth of about 300k in 2012 and is worth over 23m now so hes effective at something
watching mccarthy grovel for jim jordan is just pathetic
panning over the house its kinda crazy how many of the republicans are white men and how the democrats are much more representative of americas diversity
mchenry does not want to be speaker so its funnier hes getting any votes at all
new antijordan vote from fitzpatrick who is the republican leader of the problem solvers caucus thats big
mccarthy could not possibly look like more of a cuck right now his speech made no difference
funny thing is that a majority of maga will think this is some form of brave persistence rather than narcissism and inability to count
youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes
keep in mind the crazies forced mccarthy out because he had the audacity to work with dems to keep the government open a little longer so congress could do their fucking job
why would hunter biden do this
remember yall

jordan was trumps pick over scaliese and gop support for jordan is breaking down 

so this is a giant l for trump just like dr oz and that werewolf guy

lol he is losing by more again the anonymous gop reps were not lying theyre slowly bleeding him more and watching him lose 12 more votes every time

this is glorious jordan sucks
how many times do we need to teach you this lesson old man
we were told there were 50 gop reps against jordan and they planned to add more votes against him each subsequent speaker vote jordan is living in an alternative reality
the vast majority of americans want gym jordan 

no no they dont

mccarthy only lost votes for 9 rounds when we were voting for him

this is not the flex you think it is
being a republican must be exhausting with the amount of mental gymnastics they constantly have
jim jordan said he is not backing down even after 25 republicans  the most so far  voted against him on the third speaker ballot 

you guys said were gonna lose 15 to 30 he told cnn we only lost a couple we had a couple of absents who would have been for us 

jordan added that he will keep trying to get more votes during their conference meeting at 1 pm et

were gonna try i think so and you know we have conference in like an hour he said

lmaooo we just lost a couple if you ignore the 20 others previously lost we are making progress
jordan i just need to threaten more wives im not quitting
bipartisanship means they have to vote for my candidate
annabelle michigan

a reddit user hey represent shes says theres no path for him shes right she sounds young love to hear the youth speaking up good call
jordan lost  jim jordan lost a secret ballot hes no longer the speaker designate for the house gop

margin was large

leaving for the weekend while having absolutely no plan and a looming government shutdown and 2 wars are occurring while blaming the democrats when you have the majority is some buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuullshit

they are falling over themselves to blame the democrats lol what a pathetic fucking embarrassment they are
kinda shows how scared the gop is of violence from their electorate that only 25 voted against jom jordan publicly but over 110 did on secret ballot
 well have to go back to the drawing board what history will look at the crazy eights led by gaetz the amount of damage theyve done to this party this country is insurmountable ive never seen this amount of damage done with just a few people for their own personalities mccarthy said

 and really its astonishing to me and were in a very bad position as a party he said im concerned about where we go from here

amazing gaetz truly has no idea what hes done purely for the lolz and attention
seriously the first thing the new speaker or even mchenry if hes still in the running as temp should do is kick gaetz and his band of idiots out of the house dont censure dont rip away their committees full on kick them out for the fucking clown show theyve caused something that should have never been agreed to one person can force a new speaker vote has now cost like 3 weeks worth of time when the us needs to be actually moving and doing shit including yknow funding itself take them out of the running and force new elections for those areas get someone actually competent in their seats
the real news here is jordan accepting the result of an election
is jordan going to hold a stop the steal rally outside the chamber after this
apparently jim was just booted out of the running by a secret vote of gop members

aaaaand im touching myself tonight

jim jordan is like if the chewbacca defense was a person a weasely loud weak person who cant come up with good arguments so he just presents himself as arrogant and tries to confuse his audience he would be a godawful speaker
i like how democrats were supposed to just vote for mccarthy without getting anything in return and since mccarthy didnt offer them anything its the democrats fault for not voting to keep him
httpswwwthreadsnetbidenharrishqpostcyn4pxavdq2igshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq video

 leader jeffries jim jordan doesnt believe that president biden was elected in 2020 he is a clear and present danger to our democracy
i feel like mccarthy is about to talk about the tender kisses he and jordan shared in ohio farmhouse
deleted
mccarthy steps up to nominate jim proceeds to lose by more than ever
hey patrick i thought of something funnier than 24
watch mchenry step down and say fuck all yall and im taking this gavel with me and just proceeds to bang the gavel on the walls down the hallways and out the door
it seems that the reporting about the 50 republicans planning to increase the no votes every time to force jim to quit was accurate
republicans talking point that 4 of us brought this on along with 100 of democrats is so utterly lame  when you have the majority it does not matter what a unified minority does  you all should have your act together
its amazing how quickly ive grown to hate nancy mace considering that i literally never heard of her two months ago
so kudos to the holdouts who are set against jordan becoming speaker doing the right thing in the face of pressure and threats

but they really need to present an alternative path beyond just no jordan or this shitshow will only continue indefinitely
 new the gaetz 8 have sent a letter to colleagues saying theyre willing to accept whatever punishment  censure getting kicked out of conferencecommittees  if it means holdouts will back jordan basically offering themselves as tribute in lastditch attempt to help jordan

httpsxcommzanonastatus1715403227548573726s46tukr1tshxveunp4_vn5gzrw
gasp some republicans apparently have a secret resolution to remove bowtied minithor as temporary speaker

im not sure how i feel about this will miss the massive gaveling
just waiting on the reports of shouting heard outside the conference and another rep lunging at another rep
they need to run this like the papal vote and lock the fuckers in a room with white bread and water until they elect
this morning jordan said he was prepared to vote continously through the weekend to elect a speaker

now the next internal vote will be tuesday with no guarantee of a floor vote that day
she makes it sound like jeffries is about to come running out to the ring
thank you bacon very cool
i think jordan should try one more time nothing is making me happier than seeing him fail
trump might go to jail today for breaking his gag order in nyc and jordan aint got the votes again today was a good day
has the gop considered threatening more spouses
van orden is not here because he decided hed rather be in a war zone than be in the house chamber

honestly understandable
im starting to think madison cawthorn might have been right about one thing
an associated press photographer snapped a gop lawmaker reading through a resolution booting acting speaker patrick mchenry from his post

the ire towards the gaetz 8 coming out of these interviews is hilarious
breaking news

 jim jordan lost a secret ballot vote of the house gop behind closed doors sources tell cnn

 rep barry moore had said that members were taking a yes or no vote in their conference meeting on whether to keep jordan as their nominee for speaker

also breaking news 

 jim jordan according to rumors has told his colleagues that he wont give a shit about the ballots outcome and will stay speaker nominee even if another candidate is eventually elected by the house he also wants a highly dependent election commission to investigate whether the last three house voting rounds were subject of voter fraud

edit just for the record the last bit is a joke at least for now
call these fuckers out every single time they blame democrats every time they are cowards
thats still 194 republican congress members that would happily vote for a rape enabler that helped a criminal try to steal a presidential election thats still very alarming
why would the democrats not save us 

how could they let us look like fools like this certainly wed bail them out if their caucus was in shambleswouldnt we 

looks at camera
the house gop secret ballot for jordan says a lot more than the fact that a majority of house gop hates jordans guts it gives a glimpse of how many house gop are ready and willing to move on from trump but enjoy their political careers too much to voice it its unsurprisingly a lot

im sure youd see a similar break if they had a secret ballot on whether trump should be the gop potus nominee
over at rconservative theyre keeping busy accusing each other of being leftist traitors
don bacon has changed his vote

from mccarthy to mchenry
dems in array
being on the west coast is great  i wake up jordan has already lost another vote  its great
its honestly a relief the jordan holdouts didnt give into his pressure campaign literal fucking death threats harassing their wives threats of stalking 

but nope didnt make a lick of a difference 

get fucked jordan
anybody know what the laughing was about just now
10 more votes and other might beat jordan too
its looking like the rumors are true jordans opposition is adding more votes against him with each round
the few semiliterate people in the gop room decided this would be a very bad look and that they should agree behind closed doors for a speaker before coming to the floor  
  
everyone agreed until gymothy said nah fuck yall and began a massive fucking slam dunk on themselves  the movie they write about this one day is going to be fucking amazing  
  
when stupid runs the room
wow  mccarthy blaming dems again is just low
hahah i kind of like this mchenry guy he hasnt done anything overly fucky during this process  hes probably a shitbag overall but thus far im enjoying his little giggles up there  
  
i know gavelgate is a thing but i like this little dudes fire
wow at cheesebro right after jordan commits a faceplant hat trick 

hell of a day so far
wonder what shirt mace is going to wear in protest this week since shes a serious politician solving serious problems
threatening wives isnt working time to go after the mistresses
gym shoves work onto other people because he doesnt understand how to do his job
 mccarthy said of jordan he is straightforward honest and reliable

tell that to ohios wrestlers

oh and wheres the evidence against hunter where are your whistleblowers 

such honesty
we held 3 votes this week  they each took over two hours  who cares if the government is broken and 2nd in line to president is vacant   you cant possibly expect us to spend a working weekend after that

ladies and gents your gop earning their extremely large salary
its just cracking me up every time they try to make this a democrat problem democrats are united republicans have the majority and cant get on the same page
i wish i could say i was shocked that we are so divided that not even 5 or 6 republicans will just vote for jeffriesor hell suggest a different democrat to vote for it would take less than 10 of them to pick up their tiny ballsacks and vote for the good of the country but it looks like trump has every single one of them up his ass i guess
eventually the noncrazy republicans will need to make a bipartisan deal with the dems 

yes it will be embarrassing and yes it will end the careers of those who cross the aisle but there must be at least four republicans who are not looking to be reelected willing to fall on their swords for the good of the country right
i genuinely dont see how anyone could see the last year since midterms and think republicans have any interest in governing 

i know theres lies and biased media but how can they not see how at each others throats they all have been for the last year they dont even pretend to have an interest in policy anymore and no one even cares

guilty pleas representatives getting into shouting matches on the floor kicked out of theaters proposing no legislation showing nudes on the house floor farcical hearings that dont relate to anything in politics blatant lies petty fights and bargains when is the breaking point
hey republicans yeah you on rconservative who like to peek over the wall no fucking democrat is going to vote for gym jordan not one either they put up a guy wholl actually work with democrats a little and make the machinery of government work or thisll just keep happening
how much does mccarthy hate himself to go up and do this what a schmuck
mccarthy is the cspan caller of former speakers
no wonder it took this guy fifteen tries to get the speakership
trump doesnt understand what losing is

mccarthy doesnt understand what losing is

jim jordan doesnt understand what losing is

are we tired of all this winning yet
there are kind of two problems jordans running into

the first and most important is that the defectors generally dont want anything from him they want jordan not to be speaker they dont want pork for their districts and jordan to be speaker they want jordan not to be speaker when those are the terms you cant get a negotiation happening

the second is that jordan doesnt understand the term negotiation he doesnt really get what it means he hasnt had to do one before he doesnt have the slightest idea of what to do with defectors
our democratic rep cancelled her town halls so she could be there voting until this gets resolved i think unless you are sick or have a family emergency you should make it your business to be there
thehonorablepatrickmchenryofnorthcarolinahasreceived6 yeah thats me
lol a handful of maga republicans trying to play martyr now on cspan offering to be censured expelled punished in some way in order to get the holdouts on board with jordan
its about the 8 of us  exactly  the larger majority of republicans fucking want you guys to get fucked  you are the minority of your party and they want you to fall in fucking line  
  
its like these people dont even hear themselves speak
democrats well vote for gym jordan for speaker if he agrees to resign along with gaetz boebert mtg gosar biggs et al
they really think they can pull another mccarthy what are they going to promise the moderates because mccarthy only won by giving away the store to the holdouts
the chance of a full blown fist fight in congress has to be at its highest since the civil war

please please god do the funny thing
alexander a republican

is now ashamed to call himself a republican he doesnt believe there are republican moderates hes right and that the gop is the party of trump right again 

alexander is spitting facts too bad i dont believe hes vote for anyone other than a republican come 2024 but maybe hell prove me wrong
why are the democrats doing this to us  cspan caller
its almost like jim jordan chip roy and the other freedom caucus members are insurrectionists who do not believe in democratic governance they hold less than 5 of the seats in one half of one branch of government and they want it all their way or they will wreck it all

they arent interested in making deals they arent interested in talking or negotiating they want to threaten intimidate and instill fear

they are going to keep pushing jordan while they attack the holdouts with focused rightwing media messaging at the grassroots
httpstwittercomolivia_beaversstatus1715426818679881900

 news jordan loses by secret ballot source tells me

its jorver

isnt it funny how they can go against him when its secret but not when they have to put names to paper

probs worth mentioning as comparison that uk speaker elections are secret ballots and nominations have to be supported by mps from multiple parties and by convention the role alternates between the two major parties regardless of which one is in the majority
lmao jordan lost the secret gop ballot he is no longer the nominee
httpstwittercomolivia_beaversstatus1715428371918643362

yes we should step down love

no its our birthday and we wants the speakership precious gollum gollum

be reasonable love none of our friendses voted for us

nasty wicked tricksy false

we dont wants the speakership

jordan attempting to convince himself to step out of the running

edit quotation mark
republican luna both sides should condemn death threats

also republicans those jan 6 people were just taking a peaceful tour of the capitol
kevin hern didnt vote to certify the election so he should be a nonstarter for any democrat negotiations
i would guess that as republicans get more desperate ie they see themselves careening towards a longterm government shutdown that will be entirely blamed on them without even a plausible way to involve democrats in the blame they ultimately vote to give patrick mchenry temporary expanded powers to move legislation on the budget and aid packages 

theyll need the democrats to help with that which the democrats are only incentivized to do if the budget being moved is something they can supportso that would necessitate negotiating a bipartisan budget first
this shit is cringe af
mccarthy being a cuck for both trump and trumps taint licker gym jordan  
  
pathetic and sickening
mccarthy playing the uno reverse card trying to humiliate jordan by advising this strategy to keep voting

looking like an absolute clown in the process though
maybe threatening the families and loved ones of your colleagues wasnt the smartest choice gym
he did it  jordan exceeded the no vote yet again 23  what an amazing candidate
cant wait for the next 4 hours of closed door meetings where republicans sternly shake their fist at gaetz before deciding to go home for the weekend
at least mccarthy was making some sort of progress each vote the hell is this accomplishing
i didnt think it  could get funnier than kevin cucking himself earlier  

basically he said jim please fuck my wife and jim is now replying dude i cant get it up
oh man maga seems to be collapsing on itself a lot more lately and seemingly all at once 

chesetoes going to trial today

maga gop cant even elect a speaker

trumps getting a jail warning and about to lose his business 

and this is just the tail end of 2023

2024 is gonna be a roller coaster
lowest amount of votes for the majority candidate in 100 years

way to go gymbo
no john boehner votes this is an outrage

me watching gaetz wearing sunglasses on an overcast day on his typical rant

he gonna cry in the car
can they please televise the brawl thats going to happen behind closed doors
rapped on the knuckles  did gaetz just reveal another kink of his
we will take any slap on the wrist you offer as long as you let our guy become speaker so trump can have an edge in the next election

 representative others for speaker of the house
so whats the plan now  have another conference meeting that erupts in chaos followed by another failing vote
stay in the fucking house until a speaker is chosen

kicking the can down to fucking tuesday come the fuck on
republicans better lose every single race for next fifty years this isnt a normal party
trying to blame the democrats is amazing
the timeline looks to be

noon sunday deadline to declare interest in running

monday candidates forum

tuesday morning conference vote on a candidate

so the earliest we could see ballot 4 on the house floor is probably tuesday afternoon  and that assumes that someone can come out of conference with 217  i dont see how you get there unless you decide what is the lesser of two evils  youre either gonna have to figure out how to kneecap the gaetz band or work with the democrats on a consensus candidate
jim jordan says he accepts he lost after secret ballot results read

makes a fucking change
no anna luna this is not a failure on both sides
only 86 wanted him to stay in the race lol
i hope this emboldens some of the less extremist republicans moving forward its a definite win for the moderates lets hope they show some modicum of courage in the future instead of cowering to the great orange turd
looks like a lot of barrel scrapping is starting to happen as more than a half dozen repubs now want to try to be speaker
ok now republicans get just a bit more courage and break free from your orange fuhrer who is convinced of his absolute power and greatness

but we all know you still cower in fear and bow in obedience to a 77 yearold obese rapist all republicans remain intent on breaking democracy while hugging a bible and waving a flag and pandering to the ego of their leader
jake tapper come on this is like high school

rep womak thats offensive to high schoolers this is junior high
having mccarthy give the nomination speech for gym is a choice
3 in the bs means jj is fd in the a
after jim officially fails this third bid at speakership he will have eclipsed his number of failed attempts to pass the bar by one and be halfway to matching the number of known accusers who stated he concealed the abuse happening at osu
eff republicans obviously but this is even worse than january  at least mccarthy made an effort to reach out to his holdouts and actually got some of them on board  jordan has no plan and these votes are useless
weird how one side is mostly guys
you think we can convince michael jordan to sue jim jordan for damages no jordan has ever lost this much its gotta be hurting air jordans brand by association
jordan getting applause for voting for himself when we already know he has lost this vote by more than last time is very schadenfreude
no one flipped to jordan from yesterday so far is that correct if so this is such a failure on republican partys side like what are they even doing
looks like the we drew straws and plan to increase jordans loss each round story was true about the 50 never jordan rs
i guess threatening your coworkers is not an effective way of changing their votes
mccarthy is such a cuck
millermeeks not voting for jordan after getting threats for her 2nd rd vote solidifies her in the neverjordan group
were up to 25
republicans cant even count to 217 no wonder they want to abolish the department of education
people cheering for jeffries and mchenry and him chuckling and none for jim jordan lmaoooo
this really just shows in real time how shitty republicans are at planning theyve had plenty of time plenty of space and three votes to know the numbers they just bring it to the floor without even knowing or having a real plan and just winging it because they sent enough threats to other members families to have hope
were publicly humiliating gym jordan again awesome
house republicans to meet behind closed doors at 1pm to vote on whether or not gym should remain the nominee

httpstwittercomjakeshermanstatus1715399394151874845

i am actually enjoying gym jordan getting destroyed vote after vote way more than i enjoyed kevin mccarthys demise
hahaha pat fallon blaming dems for mccarthy
instead of trump eating cheeseburger chesebroger eating trump

guilty plea  flip number two even as gym gets humiliated again

this is not a bad day
despite the backlash i think jordan and allies are going ramp up the harassment and threat campaign bigly over the weekend he has literally no other move he can make now its either quit or send more death threats
at this point hakim jeffries may have the largest aggregate vote total for speaker nomination in house history 17 rounds and 212 votes per round

attention gop you are the majority this 210 shit is just shit
maybe we should give that mccarthy another shot

for the last time kevin we know you are the one saying that

man im trying to stop drinking and hearing jordan lose cheesebro flip and now jordan out of the running i really want to celebrate with a beer later 

damnit
they get out early on a friday and get a 3 day weekend must be nice
one of gyms supporters literally left the country bc he knew gym wouldnt get the votes lmao
the most hilarious thing the person nominating for the democrats could do is just stand up and say i nominate hakeem jeffries and sit back down
lmao that clap d
fitzpatrick went from jordan to other
jordan has lost more with every single round this is dumber than mccarthys 15 rounds
this has to be it for jordan right this isnt like with mccarthy where the margin was slowly reduced it grows each time he has no chance
lol gym jordan is losing even harder than before and we still are not even done with this round
the republican house spent two weeks preparing to elect a new speaker and the best they could do was spend an entire week holding votes for the same guy who did worse every time
24 against how could hunter biden do this
why are they bringing this to the floor before they know they have the votes 

shouldnt they figure this out in their little huddles
for just the second time in history a parties nominee for speaker will not reach 200 votes both times have been by gym jordan
i need bill hader to make a surprise comeback on snl as angry jim jordan this weekend

remember this being said after the second vote i wonder what he has to say now

when you consider that the detractors were predicting 8 to 10 8 to 12 additional no votes and that didnt materialize thats a victory for jim rep andy ogles rtenn told the messenger
i genuinely dont understandrepublicans whole thing is we are fed up with politicians and political bs and want to drain the swamp but then they keep electing people who keep the country in political paralysis because of shit like this
gym its obvious they dont want you

well sure they do  i just havent coerced or threatened the other voters enough

youve been doing that for days and youre losing votes  perhaps its time to step aside

nah if i keep holding votes with no change in strategy well get there
looks like the report that antigym gopers staggering their votes against him was true

at this point the only reason why gym would keep trying is to find more names to sic maga on
i want one member of congress to say on the record

he didnt speak up for ohio state wrestlers why the fuck should he be the speaker of the house
love how gavel man gets more applause than jordan lol
first caller im very disappointed in the republicans

wait a selfaware caller

they should have stuck with jordan

nope typical cspan caller
derrick van orden r missed the vote as he embarked on what he described as a factfinding mission in israelhttpseujsonlinecomstorynewspolitics20231020repderrickvanordenleavesdcforfactfindingmissioninisrael71243868007

uhh what
i love how these politicians say its the will of the people to put gym in the speaker role only maga people want it and maga isnt close to the majority of americans
republican logic

fetterman having a stroke and biden having a stutter are chaotic

republicans shutting down congress for no reason is necessary and what governing looks like
jordan saying he isnt dropping out what a clusterfuck
the only thing all republicans seem to agree on is that its the democrats fault for not stepping in to save the republicans from themselves

other than that the party has broken into two wings corporate conservatives and evangelical reichwingers  most of the party will vote for whatever theyre told while these two wings are in direct conflict because they support the desires of two very different constituencies  

in the end either the conservatives have to smother the reichwingers with money the reichwingers have to terrorize the conservatives into submission or one of the groups has to splinter off and form a new party  i dont see any other real options
a family meeting as in a meeting to threaten more families
darn it i totally missed season 3 of gym jordan  the humiliation of gym

will there be a season 4
would it be delving too much into the mind of a psychopath to ask why republicans even allowed a third vote with that whip count to even happen
whats amazing to me is that jordans people keep talking about the 15 votes mccarthy needed ignoring that mccarthys opposition was never so large that he dropped to tie a record for the fewest votes for a majority candidate and also ignoring that the 15 votes were held pretty much back to back for four straight days 

with more time between votes and about the same amount of time in real measurements of time jordan has lost 7 votes and flipped just two votes in his favor i believe the two repubs absent from todays votes are both jordan votes mccarthy even at his worst lost just 3 votes from his original count one of the lost votes went to present which questionably not a flip so in terms of comparing the two in the realities of the situation jordan has lost more than twice the amount of yes votes and gained just two in the same amount of days it took mccarthy to win and with more time to try to get the yes votes because the votes didnt have to just keep going
am hearing that i am the new republican nominee for speaker of the house
its almost like gym jordan is really bad at politics
heres a look at the candidates as the gop begins round 3 of finding a speaker
from cnns hill team
with the gop speakership now once again up for grabs heres a list of potential candidates and where they stand on getting in the race they have until noon et sunday to file

confirmed candidates

rep kevin hern of oklahoma republican study committee chair
rep austin scott of georgia who challenged jordan last time
rep jack bergman of michigan a former general
rep tom emmer of minnesota majority whip
rep byron donalds of florida freedom caucus member
considering running

rep mark green of tennessee homeland security chair and freedom caucus member
rep jodey arrington of texas budget chair
rep mike johnson of louisiana vice conference chair
holy crap listening to all these guys come out of conference and talk about how its still all the dems fault is hilarious  that may play on fox news but i dont think the rest of the country buys it
mccarthy has now changed his tone blaming the crazy 8 as he calls it for putting the party in a bad place 

i have no remorse 4 years of republicans having a chance to grow a spine and stand up to trumpism  maga nuts including jordan and mccarthy and they still dont get it a little self reflection would go a long way kevin 

httpsxcomacynstatus1715437980805218314s20
republicans need to realize the only path forward is working with democrats  the maga wing is perfectly happy with no speaker  no speaker means a government shutdown no speaker means the 100 billion dollar bill biden just asked for fails  they are happy with those results
this congress has fewer speakers than my first car that only had one working speaker
regardless of the side youre on i love when cspan callers talk too fast and start to get out of breath theyve probably been on hold for an hour and keep rehearsing what they are gonna say and then they whiff when it comes time
just remember the people who call in to rant to cspan are the type of people who would call in to rant to cspan
please just fucking vote the speeches are so long 
katherine clark is just dropping the entire dccc oppo book on jordans toes
its crazy how republicans would rather fight themselves and threaten their own families instead of just being normal and working with democrats to find a compromise
so the mccarthy votes are switching to mchenry then
republicans have the majority right now so its on them to elect a speaker if you have 20 different members who say theyll never support jim then its time to move on to someone else
at what point does jeffries officially accumulate the most ever votes for speaker of the house without actually being elected to the position
dont let your hakeems be dreams do it
the claps after he votes for himself kill me every time
that applause for jordan was a bit louder than the applause after my 6th grade recorder recital
another flip tom kean jr flipped from jordan in the past two rounds to other today
and another l  well done conservatives
thats 4 votes that have flipped from mccarthy to mchenry today
tapper the beatings will continue until morale improves
ill loving the jim jordan losing the speaker vote trilogy
it is absolutely pathetic that the republicans that dont want to vote for a seditionist had to make a secret plan to make sure the seditionist received fewer votes each round why so that the fuhrer doesnt know who to threaten sad
come on jordan you can do it  you can lose by even more votes today
from nyt  
so far jordan has not flipped any of the holdouts his way instead three republicans are newly opposing him
for those keeping score of flips so far jordan has successfully gotten 2 nos to flip to yeses on him though spartz probably shouldnt be counted as a flip he did so much as a person with no consistency there seem to be 25 nos for him so 7 people who voted yes on jordan on ballot 1 are now flipped to no 

thats called losing ground
just imagine for a moment the absolute chaos if even one single r had the balls to vote jeffries
i dont know who this representative others is but hes getting more vote each time
watch mchenry quit
lol at the minority rep getting a huge round lol at mchenry laughing at his own votes he seems well humored at the very least
awww bowtie is blushing after that applause
hahaha a republican just called into cspan and said they should make trump the interim speaker i dont understand how people can suck trump off so hard
of course gaetz thinks jim jordan is inspiring

he probably wishes far more americans were willing to look the other way when pedos are predating on children
gaetz jordan doesnt lead by strong arm tactics

lmfao
according to cnn it sounds like the gop is going to vote behind closed doors whether they want to keep putting jordan up
what the fuck are these jabronis talking about right now
so how many more votes does jordan have to lose before jeffries gets a majority and not the plurality
the clowns on cspan right now are really pretending they are valiant martyrs right now as if this entire mess isnt their fault
just vote chatgpt for speaker at this point
we all know who the real winner is here  the panera bread near the capitol all these multihour screaming matches are hungry work
mace me me me  me me me me me  me  me  me me me me me me me thank me
the people dont want jordan  get out of here with that shit
its so funny to know that the happenings of today are a direct result of the shit show of trumps legal situation the more he and his unpaid lawyers fucks up the worse the gop fractures and its only noon
we did it reddit
a redditer caller which one of you
debra  jim jordan is a clear and present danger to the republic

d
gym humiliated himself for nothing this is a good day
lol not the democrats getting the blame 
i never thought id say this but thank you matt gaetz for bringing this shit show into our lives
httpstwittercomjakeshermanstatus1715432320490954884

scalise will not try for the speakership again he said
republicans are such a freaking clown show lol but honestly im happy to see at least 20 holdouts amongst republicans i was sure jordan was just gonna bully and cry his way into the speakership 

idk how america looks at this group of incompetent children and decides to keep voting for them
about damn time a handful of republicans show some spine and stand up to maga chaos and obstruction but the fact that jordan was a candidate and received so many votes in the first place is appalling
if jeffries became speaker it wouldnt even be for a whole day but man that would still be a very funny day
so is jordan officially out
so assuming they find a speaker next week lol thats like two or three weeks to try to pass a budget or another resolution or you get a government shutdown

im glad to see theyre putting the limited time to good use really busting a gut to get someone in the chair
i like the chances of this others fellow
low key house gop said fuck you to donald trump here
its kinda funny but the possibility of mccarthy being forced to be speaker again on the condition gaetz gets kicked out is an actual possibility
one of the few truly cathartic guilty pleasures of mine is to look in on rconservative to see their take on a subject i found myself doing it during the trump administration to read the circle jerk of abhorrent comments and celebration of somebodys pain or suffering they really seemed to enjoy watching natural disasters wreck poor and black communities i was honestly astonished at how low they will go or how depraved they could be and they really sucked each other off during j6 and the rittenhouse verdict giving similar to watching a horror movie and its also hilarious to look in when theyre taking a big l like during the republican primary debates and other stupid shit they do 

but today is incredible their party is imploding their gods accomplices are flipping they are fighting with each other moderate conservatives are dropping the party people are grandstanding and the racism is coming out they are truly shit human beings for doing this to themselves
how is this so hard to figure out  i have a bose speaker in my house and it didnt take us a million rounds to elect it
i study on the internet i do my own data analysis and well the results are that most people are trending conservative

yeah no d
time for the dems to start pointing out exactly what things jordan has had a hand in
i think we are watching mccarthy spend the last political capital he has
did mccarthy lose a bet
mccarthy playing the hits 

border border border terrorists

also lawmakers shouldnt be measured by bills passed despite how i started this speech 3 minutes ago

mccarthy called the freshmen committee members  most spoke glowingly about him speaking how hands on jordan was like with the ohio state wrestling team 
deleted
whoever clark is shes destroying gym and the whole party right now
i should be used to it by now but its still pretty stunning to watch mccarthy gaslight the entire viewing audience with his nomination speech no one in the room believes anything he said its literally someone standing in the rain and claiming its sunny
the were rumors that jordan thought he flipped the ny republicans last night so that desposito vote for zeldin may have mattered
this is the 20th time hakeem jeffries has been nominated
i cant believe mccarthys stirring speech didnt bring the party together  s
i love that he still has to sit there and listen even though theyre not even out of the fs and hes 100 lost it
the fact that mccarthy is still getting votes despite giving a nominating speech just shows how entrenched the no votes are no wonder kevin was yucking it up he knew this was dead
how many student athletes did gym allow to be sexually assaulted thats how many times he should suffer this humiliation
hakeem supreme jeffries lmao
kevin mccarthy team

maybe the team you should not listen to 

idk
it must be at least partially demoralizing to cast a vote for jordan knowing he lost about 7 letters ago
wait what was that laughter
what was the laughter for
he said the thing
so its likely we will be past the 22 votes for others yesterday
has jordan tried the trump method of yelling to stop the counting as soon as he is in the lead during the a votes
jim jordan is a legislative terrorist this is his plan

a convince people if that doesnt work 

b coerce people  if that doesnt work 

c threaten people if that doesnt work 

d make the only choice him as speaker or a nonfunctional us government
23 wooohooo
anyone catch what dana bash said on air that made her say did i just say that on air
iirc crenshaw said that he was giving jordan one more chance to show progress before he switched  so if they do this again that will be at least one more net loss
deleted
at this point even if you support jordan why would you vote for him send him a message he should give up
republicans in 2016 we  the magas thats the base of our party 

republicans in 2023 why cant we elect a speaker insert erica andre meme why did the democrats do this to us

fin
aww he lost more votes i feel bad for him 

just kidding fuck that guy
429 votes so majority is 215  jeffries still five away

hey gaetz want to take some of your buddies out to lunch might be a waitress you can harrass chat up
i wish the count from sesame street was taing the votes
well i guess those damn democrats did it again no new speaker guys

jake tapperits not that theres no path the path is increasingly heading off a cliff

in reference to the path for jim jordan to become speaker
fun fact you have to go back to 1923 and finis garrett to find someone who faceplanted harder with 195 votes
guys there is going to be gop meeting this afternoon well thatll fix the situation
fucking republican callers on cspan man i think its smart to have trump trump is backing jordan anyone voting against him is voting against trump but republicans would have to pay attention to know that shit so it is clearly over their heads
18 republicans in biden districts all this fuckery means theyre likely to lose reelection anyway so maybe find 6 that will vote for jeffries
the gop is on a crazy merrygoround and they wont get off  it is a result of the last several years of governing by clicks and chaos

we are at the republicans calling politicians with credible death threats stage of gop politics  

trump and maga gop have emboldened the fringe elements of the electorate who have no problem storming the capitol and committing political violence  this is the republican party
the will of the people  gerrymandered internal voting of a caucus that still cant get everyone on board with their proposal
lol lets hold another speaker vote see how low we can go do i hear 190 190 votes anyone
isnt the goal supposed to be to pick up more votes with each subsequent election
i can tell the republicans from the way they talk no matter what line they call in
haha keep it up gym at this rate youll have around 130 votes by the time you hit kevins magic 15
so annoyed republicans keep saying its embarrassing its not its hilarious and i want them to keep trying
i swear some of these cspan calls are like jordan klepper interviews soon well be heading into all gas no breaks territory
cspan caller were getting laughed at all over the world  

like we havent been since nov 2016
how many of you are larping for the lolz on these cspan calls dont lie haha
betty independent from alabama

says jordan should step aside 

gaetz and his crew are a joke their offer is just an attention grabbing thing probably right 

wants the democrats to accept responsibility for ousting mccarthy eye roll yeah fully independent betty right
what jordan has no record how could you be proud of it
ken republican arkansas

doesnt want jordan to apologize thinks hes stupid thinks house should have a rule change to get this thing done  wants to eliminate most radicalpoorest performers from both parties to help get a speaker what

cspan reporting that theres a resolution going around to remove mchenry as temp speaker lets just go backwards gop you only go that direction anyway
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson jim jordan
hilarious watching them desperately try to blame democrats its hilarious watching their anger and knowing theyre just making themselves look stupid
httpstwittercomolivia_beaversstatus1715429094261706782

the deep state won rep norman said after jordan lost
so utahs 2nd house district is holding a special election on november 21st

if there is still no speaker and the country is 4 days into a shutdown do you think itll give democrats a push there

its a seat that voted for trump with 56 in 2020 so not really a swing district

however democrats have been outperforming their 2020 margins by around 10 in special elections this year 

would the republican chaos give the democrats the extra push or is this seat way out of reach for them even with all of those circumstances
lets just all get used to the idea that no matter which republican nutjob eventually gets trotted out they will still most likely be objectively terrible for the country none of these people know how to generate consensus or govern through compromise none of them are good enough and none of them deserve to lead the house
nyt is reporting that jordan lost the secret ballot that just occurred and is no longer the nominee for speaker
next vote is expected around tuesday of next week thats around 15 weekdays of stoppage by republicans pathetic bootstraps
and theyre doing a new slate of speakers

again
the fever dream of kevin mccarthy is reelected after 16 rounds is immediately vacated by gaetz and then the us government shuts down because a budget is not passed is still alive
in other countries when the majority cant govern new elections are called

like everything else the us is behind on that 

you cant tell me that some of the swing districts would flip if new elections were held next week
democrats hey work with us to find a compromise for the american people


republicans fuck you we will keep having our miserable closed door meetings even if it takes us 100 voting attempts
in jesus name amen

the caller conveniently omitted to mention that according to republican lore jesus wouldnt get elected as a gop congresscritter anyway because hes one of them commie soshulists
as an american i am upset that our government is so dysfunctional that we cant even do basic things like elect a soth 

but as a democrat who hates jim jordan im delighted
ive done extensive in depth internet research that says republicans want jim jordan as the speaker ive read comments

lol sure you have
are dems legit just laughing at this
as soon as he said effective legislator i smashed the mute button so hard
and mccarthy wonders why democrats wont help them out
kevin let me tell you about all these bills that gym has passed 
also kevin if you judge a member by how many bills theyve passed youre an idiot
this is the snl cold open word for word
i hope jordan returns the favor and does a speech for mccarthy in round 19
jim jordan is an effective legislator mccarthy says that as everyone laughs at him
jake is pretty good at trolling the right i like him
jake tappers dry humour honestly gives me life i absolutely love the guy
brutal
as we know gym doesnt understand the concept of no so this still might take awhile
imagine deciding that an active war zone is preferable to the company of your coworkers
members pissed that gym is talking about holding them here during the weekend

oh boo hoo fuckers gotta work on a weekend
look if you give me the chance to run the score up on a record im putting it where nobody can get it
wilt chamberlain numbers for speaker votes
stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself
nice little victim blaming
oh well that settles it then as long as everybody is getting death threats s

do they not realize how crazy that is
these people do deserve each other
in our type of democracy its fine to threaten people into voting the way we want
powell and cheesboro both making deals thats really bad news for trump and the others
the two who asked for a speedy trial saw the evidence against them and rapidly pled guilty and flipped
is she one of the people who was doing the roll call in january

doing the whole thing three times a day was true martyrdom
nobody knows enough about them to hate them either they could be more nonpartisan kind of like what i think the speaker of the house of commons is supposed to be like here in canada
are we going to see trump loose another election today cant wait
they realized they done fucked up

the moderate republicans wont ever vote for jordan
isnt censure meaningless
the thing here is that they are so fucked if a moderate gets in they are totally getting there ass thrown out of all committees
that rumor seems more and more true each time at 24 defectors this time with 2 absences
did you know hes been in congress 16 years and has passed zero bills and has never even sponsored a passing bill you dont even have to do anything to sponsor hes literally a waste of space
man who hasnt passed any legislation in 16 years is good at government s
didnt realize hes never supported a farm bill what a jackass
his goal with this vote seems to be to prove he picked up votes so im hoping he didnt
just saw reporting that the number of rs not voting for jordan could jump from 22 to 29 or 30
i love the pod save america guys on this its a total painful divorce situation and theyre just yelling at the one parent powerless who actually cares mom  dads nowhere to be found
they are just salty that between maga jordan making himself and the house gop a laughing stock  and kraken powell flipping on trump in the rico trial they are being exposed for the idiots they are 

they need someone to blame its their nature to deflect blame and cry its other peoples fault while pretending they are the party of personal responsibility
ted cruz making calls for the trump campaign energy
he is a total piece of shit the man hes licking the balls of is the one who booted his ass
they have no leader they have no plan they have no platform no policies no solution their only objective is to scream about problems and blame someone else for them their only plan is to throw shit on the walls and then complain about the smell
nobody they dont even have a fucking platform theyre an absolute clown show of bullshit
 putin
the cheseboro no longer stands alone
thanks for that im never going to be able to look at the extra hotel room chair normally again
worse than that if it was just the democrats fault the republicans could have easily just reinstated mccarthy but they havent because he cant win either its all on the rs
no paper ballets

how do we know these vote outcomes arent stolen
dems said only if the person voted to certify 2020 and upheld the agreement mccarthy backed out on
i believe that this has always been on the table from the democrat side but they need a moderate nominee and handful of republicans to cross the picket line to get it going
what exactly do they want from the gop

to shut down the government in such a way they can blame the democrats and biden

this could very well hurt them in 24
yea just saw that what the hell is he talking about
jordan is pretty good at pretending bad things arent happening right in front of him  he keeps right on trucking
lordy thats a huge drop
russian gop vs evangelical gop the leopards have come home
its dumber than that mccarthy said he wouldnt work with democrats
heres the problem with that its all lies they will pretend that vow didnt exist the moment their guy is in and the rest of the republicans will gnash their teeth and do nothing 

their excuse thats politics
wow they really are desperate lol

kick em out of the house entirely
this is not a sign of strength this shows the weakness of gaetz and company
there are rumors jim jordan has locked himself in a side office and refuses to come out some aides have reported he could be heard sobbing
the wide gap between the public and secret ballot votes for jordan is striking bc it shows how fearful the party is of the maga base
really goes to show how brave they really are 122 people voted for him to begone but only 25 willing to actually say it in public
you have been banned from rconservative
the crazy 8s were enabled by the spineless giveaways from mccarthy hes the one who let this happen
yes he lost a secret gop ballot by a large margin
in private only they will gladly line up behind their cult leader publicly
yesterdays was even better

if only there was something in his background that would suggest he would stand by and look away when bad things were going on
he is 100 fair though which makes him one of the better tv news host out there he holds dems to the fire as well and is not afraid to call out republican lunacy
he understands it when it suits his needs example do you believe biden won the 2020 election jordan no
i mean one has of groups of crazy religious zealots who would rather kill each other than work together and the other is the middle east
when you take a break from your partys civil war to refresh with a middle east war
hey working for 3 hours a day 3 times a week is tiring
i mean if some douche nozzle like gym jordan were forcing me to stay here on the weekend when it is clear that he is not going to win id be annoyed as fuck too it would be one thing if it looked like there was some movement happening
 you should submit to terrorism

gop in 2023
really good news for the prosecution  this avoids trump and the others getting to see how some arguments work out before they try them for themselves

also really good news for jack smith who will get some testimony from these two for his trial as well
or they asked for a speedy trial so they can get to the pleading and bus throwing under before anyone else does
yes

its a press release from the us house of representatives that says were all very disappointed in you
not that bad  that was the lowest a man can go  

i dont partake in macho gatekeeping but we all know that doing the most menial political labor to help the man who called your wife ugly and your father a presidential assassin is the nadir of pride and autonomy
its dumber than that he said he would then backstabbed them
knowing people like you less in private feels worse for some reason
i dont know if that negates prior posters argument in your example he clearly demonstrates no understanding of the word no again"

get the fuck away from me you did this 

liz cheney to jim jordan 010621
friendly reminder for anyone who wants to blame the democrats

gop has enough house numbers to elect mccarthy again or jordan or flava flav or even kanye 

but theyre too dysfunctional to rally behind one person
mccarthy during speakership fuck the dems ill never work with them

mccarthy allies after mccarthy gets fired this is the dems fault for not wanting to work with us
is threatening to ruin the careers of 20 people in your party when you have yet to been elected to anything possibly a dumb move
its so funny how cspan fills time by having random callers give thanksgivingtablelevel political commentary
one republican voted for john boehner who was last speaker of the house during obamas presidency i die
httpswwwthreadsnetbidenharrishqpostcyjk1ahr4msigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq

 for the first time in modern history the majoritys nominee for speaker has received less than 200 votes

 jim jordan is making history
if youre a republican voter whos take is the dems should help out republicans then you are admitting that dems are the only ones who can govern and thus you should always vote dem
nbc news confirms before jim jordans first defeat the wife of republican rep don bacon received anonymous messages warning him to back jordans speakership bid or risk being ousted 

one message your husband will not hold any political office ever again what a disappoint sic and failure he is

another why is your husband causing chaos by not supporting jim jordan i thought he was a team player nbcnews
rep bacon to nbcnews jordan is headed for defeat hell fight to death likely and we wont let off their tactics angered us theyre harassing our spouses even jordan hit a brick wall
to reiterate the course of events here

mccarthy im not giving any concessions to democrats to stay speaker

mccarthy gets booted

scalise gets the majority of votes in an internal poll to decide who house republicans will support

those republicans renege and scalise steps down

jordan promises to govern in a very partisan very maga way

jordan cannot get the votes

maybe its just me but i cannot for the life of me understand how this is a democratic problem or why we need to step in to help the republican caucus im willing to if we get something out of it but if republicans are essentially going to govern exactly the way they would if we werent involved why should we interfere with the death spiral
what i have learned there are about 1020 maga republicans 2021 moderate republicans and 140180 go with the flow republicans
when the 17year old high schooler sounds way more sane and knowledgeable than 99 of the rest of the callers
having a christian prayer before every session and for everything in american politics is wildly inappropriate americans are all kinds of religions christian jewish muslim sikh hindu agnostic atheist you name it therell be some folks in america practicing that having the christian faith in american politics is wildly inappropriate and not at all representative of the american people

edit to be clear no matter the faith any kind of religion has absolutely no place in politics so these prayers are just wildly inappropriate whether they are christian or not
its just funny to me because if the gop was good at governing and they had a reason for voting mccarthy out youd think they would have already conversed and had a plan for who they were all going to confirm next 

instead they look like fucking idiots and the spongebob plankton meme i never thought id get this far
i hope the 20 republicans hold strong and havent been intimidated into doing the wrong thing jim jordan is beyond unqualified for the position of speaker of the house
cspan caller i got into politics in the 50s  im an independent then proceeds to say both sides are bad and jom jordan should be speaker because there is nothing objectionable about him

lol
it is unbelievably stupid how much trump has screwed up our government i wont wish death on anyone but if he could just be teleported to a different universe or plane of existence that would be great its infuriating how much of a hold an absolute idiot has on that party just absolute garbage
they should nominate santos for speaker next they could have the first black trans olympic gold medalist pope as speaker
rep lawler is so full of shit  blaming the democrats saying it should still be mccarthy and demanding bipartisanship but refusing to acknowledge that mccarthys downfall was his failure to embrace bipartisanship and the vote to remove him was bipartisan
lol boehner is taking a huge bong rip while watching himself get a vote
jim jordan is one lying and shady ass mother fucker

jake sherman is reporting that jordan and allies squashed a bid to give mchenry more power as speaker pro temp prior to the vote for jordan to be speaker because we need to get this over with now or we have to deal with democrats which will be bad for the country

the he lied to everyone that he did try to push for mchenry

he is a weasel and a liar
everyone saying dems need to help them by the end of the month to pass the farm bill and avoid a shut down  

no

the republicans will cave to their funders pressure who will lose billions if not hundreds of billions if rubber stamped pork barrel spending bills stop being passed 

they hold off long enough the pressure will be from above on the republicans to throw in behind jeffries
maybe the person who consistently get more votes should be the winner
i appreciate how there isnt even a thread over on rconservative 

imagine being so embarrassed by the people you support that you cant even discuss it in a place built only for that reason
it is hilarious that in any of our lifetimes the speaker election wouldnt even be worth watching each party nominates someone the majority partys nominee wins 

welcome to 2023 where the republican party is such a disaster that we all gather around to see how much of a shit show it is
now mccarthy is on cnn blaming the dems

the gop are the party of fools
im an independent but i lean conservative

no youre just a conservative who wants to label yourself an independent so you can look cool when you talk politics and think youre different

republicans are the party that screams about government not working then they get elected and prove themselves right
the republicans acting like its the democrats job to bail them out is my favorite kink my party has been remarkably consistent and are closer to a governing majority than any other republican candidate if the gop cares about governing theres a dude from ny who they could vote for to end this

hilarious that pence votes for jordan who wanted to lynch his brother
can we all just take a second to think back to how hilarious it was that the republicans just a year ago were predicting that 2022 was going to be a red tsunami the gop was predicting they would gain upwards of 80 seats from the democrats in 2022 arrogant fools

why doesnt jordan just declare the election fraudulent and say he got the most votes by a lot  s
jim jordan has been in congress for 16 years and of the 53 bills he was primary sponsor of none have passed he has cosponsored piggybacked other bills that passed

guy doesnt solve any problems just screams like an idiot creates problems and lets others do all the work

bonafide scumbag loser
the speaker of the house should know the outcome of a vote before it happens between jordan and mccarthy it is apparent that republicans do not understand this if you cant do the most basic part of the job you are applying for why are you applying for it
i gotta hand it to republicans when they say government doesnt work they really intend on proving it
jim jordan does not deserve to be speaker of the house

an independent who believes in make america great again and is happy the house is closed sure bernard
is mike lawler really on cnn blaming democrats for this did i just hear him blaming them
a few thoughts

1 it seems inevitable that the republicans will need to either vote for a freedom caucus member or work with the democrats to find an acceptable candidate to some members of both parties i dont see the freedom caucus capitulating 
2 for some continued dysfunction and chaos are entirely the point the freedom caucus is perfectly fine with paralyzing the house shutting down the government stalling aid for ukraine and israel and hurting the party at large their constituents will reward them for this behavior and they really only care about themselves 
3 i know were all having a good laugh at gym jordan but remember this mess has the potential of hurting a lot of people both within the us and without the house must come back to a functional state soon or its gonna be a very rough holiday season
for those watching on tv today note how much better the camera work is when cspan isnt limited by the speakers office micromanaging what they can show
at this stage how likely is a breakup of the gop in the house it is literally less than a dozen maga nutjobs which caused this issue and instead of appeasing them and alienating most of the gop they will at some point need to just oust them and face all the consequences of it at the ballot box next year
jim jordan should never be speaker  he supported and aided the insurrection is an election denier and a pedophile enabler   the man is absolutely awful and should be recalled from office but his district would elect beezelbub as long as he had an r next to his name
woah he has trouble with the votes and the speakership is free
loses votes from the first vote how great is that
cnn reporting that jim is going for another vote tomorrow

this guy needs to fuck off already
i keep seeing people calling for the republicans to pick someone more moderate to get some dem votes dems shouldnt do this and they shouldnt even try to help the republicans dems need to stop being their enablers because the republicans almost never help the dems republicans need to tidy up their house and quit expecting the party that is actually functioning to come save them while they call them demons and tell the americans public that dems are the root of all their problems
foxnews reporting they have confirmed 4 nos against jordan he cant afford to lose anyone else

you arent an independent if you support jordan this is a republican that called in on the independent line to get heard
no amount of election denying will change the results of yesterday  savage aguilar
i am old enough to remember when folks said gym had made great gains in the last 12 hours and expected to see progress during this vote if not an outright win dominion voting machines have struck again
if the antijordan faction wants to make a statement one of them should vote for jefferies and scare the shit out of everyone else make a power play
lmao he didnt break 200 this time get fucking rekt
look its easy to make fun of gym jordan for this second straight public humiliation

no i mean it its really easy give it a try its loads of fun too
lawler blaming dems for repub mess  gtfo you clown
one thing that isnt being mentioned really is that jordan is trumps pick  these dissenting votes are dissenting against trump at least in his eyes  i hope this is a wake up call  

trump has consistently been on the losing side of almsot every pick hes endorsed including this one
the votes will continue until morale improves
independent caller we need to work together

republican caller we need to get those 22 out of the house theyre not sticking together
there was a time when dems has control of the house for over 30 years straight imagine if something like that happened again as a result of this train wreck by the gop
lol losing votes on the second day 

you have to imagine jordan is like please dont arrest santos till this is over
the folks who say that we need to work together dont understand that the voters in these deep red districts dont want cooperation they want chaos all over unfounded resentment towards the elites on the coasts

at this point im perfectly fine with abandoning them further if they suffer more economically so be it theyre the minority

people need to be held accountable for how they vote
hakeem jeffries has received more votes for speaker than any candidate since 1913

it has been highly entertaining watching the republican clown show really glad democrats arent saving republicans and are letting them deal with their own internal issues
days that the republican party hasnt been a national embarrassment 0
the caller we need a strong leader jordan is a strong leader

me who couldnt pass a single piece of legislation but ok caller
austin scott on cnn blaming democrats for this situation 

these people are not serious about governing this country
this is why pelosi stuck around so long leadership of a narrow majority is extremely difficult but under pelosi the party got the votes
somewhere john boehner is looking at all this going i am so glad this shit is not my problem anymore while smoking a fat blunt
lord im sick of seeing that pathetic yellow tie
hope he loses more support
lets not forget this shows that trumps grip on congress is loosening since a vote for jordan is a vote for trumps puppet
so gym is gonna make this a one vote a day thing to drag this out and hope the detractors will cave

isnt this the same party who is demanding one day only national voting
would someone explain the strategy behind staggering their votes whats the purpose

this was posted on twitter

some of jim jordans opponents tell me theyve been purposely staggering their no votes over multiple ballots  a strategy designed to show jordans speakership opposition is only growing

and thats why they tell me jordan will bleed even more support on a third ballot
 next vote on a third ballot for jim jordan tomorrow at noon

the difference in intelligence between the democrat and republican callers on cspan is pretty shocking even though not unexpected at all
those original 8 ouster votes in the republican party could admit all this was a bit of a mistake and they could vote in mccarthy as speaker again 

that will never happen republicans stopped changing course on an issue or admitting they did something wrong around 2003 and in the 20 years since their mode of operation has made that idea completely unfathomable to them
dang jordan two failed ballots in 2 days

gotta get those numbers up rookie mvcarthy had 14 failed ballots by day 4 

if he wants to be half the failure that mccarthy was he gotta start pumping those numbers fast
lmaooo cspan cut to a live interview and it just had the audio of the journalist flirting with a dude with a nice uk accent
an hour and a half of bloviated speechgiving and one vote a day

im convinced the gop is just stalling to maintain the disorder theres an urgent crisis in the middle east the ongoing ukraine crisis about a dozen major domestic crises and these schmucks have no haste in electing a speaker of the house 

register to vote this isnt acceptable
im seeing a lot of people trying to argue that democrats should vote for a moderate republican speaker the problem with this is that any moderate is going to do even worse than jordan in whipping gop votes especially when its reported that they plan to get votes from democrats the more appealing option for democrats instead is to get 5 moderate republicans to vote for jeffries hes the closest candidate to speaker of anyone nominated after all but the real problem is this there are no moderate republicans just assholes who are holding schoolyard grudges or who are trying to appear like they have morals
jefferies is a caaahmmmunist

cspan is worse than am radio
quite apart from my opinions on jordans politics he just cant do the job he just doesnt have the legislative experience even of crafting and seeing a single bill to completion its absurd he got even a passing dishonorable mention for the job
weird how the republican members of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus arent willing to work across the aisle here 

more evidence to the fact that when they say bipartisan they really mean shut up and let me win
the gop putting up as big of a pile of human garbage as jordan as a speaker candidate is almost justifiable purely to see him get utterly embarrassed
any word on a third vote today or have they gone to melee weapons
so it is safe to assume that the freedom caucus was planning on overthrowing mccarthy from day 1 to install jordan as speaker
enough of this nonsense give them the papal treatment a locked room bread and water nobody leaves until a speaker is elected
so they just did a single vote and left again what a shitshow
goes to rconservative to see how this is the dems fault
i think i found the deep state pedophile supporters and they are not drag queens 

200 and then 199 people just publicly voted to support a known pedophileenabler to be in line for president

i have a bit of a hot take on this hot mess they will continue to try to vote and fail for a speaker for the next 40 or so days until the funding the government deadline
speaker mccarthy he had a twomonth runway from when he got the conference nomination and when we got to that first week in january so were right where he was in his numbers jordan said

how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
lol this cnn interview with austin scott does he really think all the democrats wouldnt have voted out the r speaker does he refuse to realize that the rs dont need any votes from dems to vote in a speaker the delusion of these r politicians 
i find it hilarious that republicans still want to blame dems for this lol your party is broken and dysfunctional and deserves to wither and fail it isnt dems job to make you all function
its amazing how republicans get a pass on how long this is taking the media doesnt give a shit that theyre only voting once a day and completely dragging their feet 

the republicans have hit such a level of expected incompetence they are basically immune to criticism
for a man who has passed zero legislation since arriving in dc participated and actively led an attempt at overthrowing the government and lived his life as only a series of soundbites for fox news  did anyone think this was not going to keep going this way

for those saying  its the dems fault the same arguement can be made that republicans are keeping the government closed by not voting for jeffries seriously its such a rediculous line of logic it beggars belief
these first two callers im supporting jordan because i want to know where all the money is going to in our government and all of his dissenters are getting money from questionable sources and i believe they are trying to stop jordan from doing the work of the people he has proven that he can get stuff done

fk the fox news propaganda is strong in those people
has anyone mentioned the fact that jordan is losing support despite having the open and enthusiastic endorsement of trump himself  maybe trumpy is losing that midas touch
absolutely hilarious that mchenry might become the next speaker
if republicans were good at governing theyd be doing it right now  
the republican vote on speaker is an indication that 20someodd members of their caucus recognize that their membership is so seriously compromised that they are unwilling to vote for it  yet they dont have the guts to do what is right and speak out against it andor do anything about it  that is exactly not statespersonship

i suspecthope the number is higher but they are too unwilling to risk losing the power and graft that comes with that power to even go so far as to vote against it
the republican party is fracturing in real time and im here for it stop being trumps slave and realize that you as a representative are there to work and pass bills lead or get out of the way there is no other way to look at it unless youre blind to your own biases grand obstructionist party can fracture into irrelevant parties and we would be better off for it

3 hasnt passed legislation in their 16year career
4 was implicated in abuse by at least six people
5 cant pass the bar exam
6 is unable to stack the deck at his own committee hearing

is crazy
did santos really say with the spirit of long island jordan  


what a fucking clown
if my math is correct is jordan going to have less votes this time around
4 lost 1 flipped 1 new present gained net 2

he cannot do better than 2 still can try to flip spartz and womack
wait jeffries has 213 did a goper actually flip

its interesting i took a peep at rconservative and there isnt any news or headline at all that i saw about jordan and this speaker election debacle lol i wonder why
just caught the tail end of a cnn interview on the radio speaking with a gop house rep didnt catch who that kept saying over and over again the democrats are to blame for not having a speaker  the logic 208 democrats or 96 of the vote were the majority that voted to oust mccarthy  no matter what they asked he kept coming back to this statement and blaming the whole mess on the dems
im honestly shocked there arent 5 republicans willing to go with jeffries i would have thought there would be a few level headed logical thinkers on that side but i suppose ive been giving them too much credit
and the republican party continues to demonstrate to the american people that it is incapable of governing even the adults in the gop room are too cowardly to rally around a moderate in exchange for the few dem votes it would take to end this circus cant wait until next november when the voters issue them their just consequences for the continuing damage they insist on causing to our democracy
if this was a secret ballot jeffries would win enough republicans are secretly fed up enough to just let him take over so they can actually get shit done but theyd never win another election within the gop if they voted openly
reading reports that jordan camp morale is sinking is music to my ears as of yesterday morning it was all but certain he was going to win the votes after a couple rounds
why are the dems open to temporarily empowering mcpatrick mchenry this is wholly a problem created by rs tell a couple of em to get behind jeffries or get mcfucked
msnbcs reporter just said he is expected to get less support today than yesterday why hold the vote again right now if he expects to lose
someone go on cspan and tell all the republicans to vote for rfk jr
mods can we get a daily cspan callin discussion thread  basically an mst3k for wonks
we might only be in the cs

but jordan is already in the ls
hes going to end up much worse this round lol awesome maybe dont threaten peoples wives and careers for their compliance not everyone lacks a backbone
lmao someone voted for fucking boehner dissenters are memeing and i am for it
john boehner is sobbing at home right now
msnbc cut away from the vote  fox isnt showing it either lol
obligatory fuck rep pence
good for you jim  you gained one vote

and lost three others

im really seeing the leadership skills here
ok cspan has flipped things back to 212 for jeffries

jordan 199 jeffries 212 other 22

no way they try another vote today unless its to expand mchenrys authority as pro tem
i have to say the idea to rig the 2022 election for a very narrow republican win was a very funny move by the deep state
if jordan had any concept of shame he would be deeply embarrassed by this
it would take 5 republicans to end this mess if they worked with democrats
from nyt

we are waiting for house clerks to finalize the tally and sign the roll but pending any last minute  and unexpected  changes jim jordan will fall short in the second ballot by an even larger margin than the first he was only able to flip one of the republican holdouts while the opposition grew
deleted
can we have a ongoing live thread anytime cspan takes calls  its kinda my favorite thing  i like to close my eyes and pretend im playing gta
has gym tried putting on a second suit jacket or a 3 piece suit maybe thatll get him the votes 
gym has stated he is staying in lets try to double 22 to 44 by weeks end
who would win virgin americans going two weeks without a speaker or chad belgians going two years without a government
the fact that everyone but the republicans on these phone lines are saying that jim jordan isnt qualified means a lot get literally anyone else on the line democrats dont want jim jordan independents dont want jim jordan republicans should stop telling everyone what to do
lol after all the comments here about cspan callers i had to turn it on this is amazing

the democrats can just vote for jim jordan okay lady
is it me or has gaetz been uncharacteristically quiet
you know what time it is jeffries 212
lamo he lost votes what a joke
man who never gathered votes for his own legislation struggling to gather votes for his election to the top position of the house
maga reds are exactly like a toddler whos mad they cant eat dog food and piss all over the house so they hold their breath and threaten to pass out while blaming democrats for them being covered in piss and choking themselves
next speaker ballot

jim jordan  

rodney dangerfield  x 

kevin mccarthy  

peewee herman  
republican steve womack says a third vote will go even worse for jordan
i think jordans strategy is to drag this on until the govt shutdown forces people to either vote for him or shut it all down

what a great strategy either accept me as your leader or burn the whole thing down
any word on another vote today
enjoying the circus thats what you get when you elect clowns to represent you 
are they doing another vote today
thoughts and prayers to the conservatives subreddit keep on distracting from the real issues
why do all republican cspan callers sound like they were educated in rural alabama 50 years ago
gotta love the screaming inside face on cspan dude as he has to listen to this
every senator should have term limitsits ridiculous they can be in the house forever caller

does he know what he is talking about
lead gas really did a number on this country jesus christ
mother fucker just openly said they want to gut ss and medicare
if only ny had not fucked up in nov 2022 we wouldnt be in this mess
since theyre voting for random ass people now wont someone please vote jeb just for the meme
say what you will about pelosi and jeffries theyve got their people in line
ive read that jordan tried to hardballthreaten members who didnt vote for him first time and it backfired can anyone fill me in on that
even boehner is getting votes what a circus lmao
 we just need 5 republicans to vote for hakeem jeffries 

 when will the media start asking why republicans refuse to work with democrats and elect the speakernominee hakeem jeffries with the most votes and support

httpswwwthreadsnetkeithedwardspostcyjbx5ou65oigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq
and now officially gymbo is doing worse than yesterday congratulations i didnt think anything could be more embarrassing than mccarthy going down but this is really taking it to another level

golf clap
worst jordan performance ever and he didnt even have to face the celtics or the pistons
so two votes now where jeffries has received more votes than the other guy but hes unaccountably still not speaker  i declare voter fraud
jordan lost the second round even worse than the first

he is fundamentally unable to function as a politician the pursuit of these strongman authoritarian tactics to bully support from his dissenters does not work in a functioning democracy
i think its pretty clear that america doesnt want a complete nutter holding the gavel so its time for the pubs to jettison the nutters and work with the moderate dems
theres no path for jordan were gonna end up with mchenry serving out the rest of this congress as speaker pro tempore
oh they gave up already sad low energy guac bowl
the fact that so many people laughed about boehners votesthey know this shit is not getting resolved today
whats interesting to me is that the 25 or so people who have voted against jordan so far are not aligned in their alternative choice they have no consensus candidate or a single person who could negotiate as a block 

this makes it harder for jordan to negotiate those individuals are goi g to sink him 

of course now the question is who is the alternative
theres no way he reduces 22 to under 5 especially when he has been trending downwards but republicans cant be relied upon when it comes to math and counting or facts and reality of any sort not when they believe in trickle down economics and that they won the presidential election lol
republicans are like squealing babies but just wait until the gummint checks stop arriving for their constituents next month  then things are gonna get really loud

i guess fucking around and finding out is how many of us learn
how do we get it to a public vote nationwide where we vote to cut these jackoffs pay drastically since everyones always talking about bipartisan votes im sure that would pass with overwhelming numbers
jim can keep calling for another round of voting until the cows come home right since he doesnt care about the government shutdown or defaulting on the federal debt he can keep doing this hoping enough republicans relent and surrender isnt that right
since us politics is already a parody i nominate weird al yankovic for speaker of the house
how would this nospeakerofthehousedelay benefit trump as we near elections
i have absolutely no idea whats going to happen and i dont like it
i need everyone to know matt gaetz is a hero

insert the laugh track here
matt gaetz is a hero









okay that was christine from missouri
oh wow just flat out saying we are going to cut medicaid and social security with jordan as speaker
ill never not laugh at republicans self owning by embarrassing themselves for cheering for the most unpopular shit and then realize theyre the only ones clapping
bacon get my wifes number out of your texts
buchanon switched from jordan
i legit do not understand the rationale of bringing it to the floor unless you are 100 of the outcome
gym fucked around by intimidating his colleagues to give him the gavel now hes gonna find out for a second time
theyre losing ground there wont be a third vote the chatter about expanding the role of the temporary speaker was picking up before this vote even started that will be the focus now why they cant just vote for the temporary speaker remains a mystery though presumably he cant get the votes either which means the party is completely broken
the party that wants to fix our elections is about to have their 20th vote in 2 election cycles for 1 office bc they cant wrap their heads around basic civics
lol a vote for boehner this is a circus
boehner as in john boehner

i love how the republicans are just fucking around now
did i just hear someone vote for boehner that fucker
millermeeks is a new flip right
so is jim jordan going to deny the results of this election
i had to step away and pretend like i have a job

x200b

so jordan has already lost again
currently

mariannette millermeeks of iowa

drew ferguson of georgia

vern buchanan of florida

pete stauber of minnesota

flipped their votes from jordan between the 1st and 2nd ballot

doug lamalfa of california 

victoria spartz of indiana

flipped their votes to jordan between the 1st and 2nd ballot
the pence brother voting for a man who attempted to arrange his brothers assassination should make for an awkward thanksgiving but with republican family values there will be no problem
it would appear that jordan is not in fact gaining support
21 and thats it gym needs to give up the leadership race after this vote more and more republicans will vote against him if there are future rounds
hes already lost again lol i counted more votes against him than last time on the new york times live vote counter
couldnt even get 200 votes and youre in the majority fucking pathetic
the sky is blue the sun is hot and hakeem jeffries gets 212 votes for speaker
emmer said theyre trying another vote today well see but it seems like a real dumb idea
looks like jordans threats to representative spouses didnt work out
why doesnt gym just pull a kari lake and pronounce himself speaker then run again
such a hard decision do we vote for the guy who is a hardright election denier with active lawsuits and investigations who has never passed a piece of legislation in his entire career or do we vote for the qualified guy

depends whats the little letter next to his name 

ffs
why arent any republicans ringing gaetz neck for causing this and not standing behind another speakerif they want to blame anyone
lawler needs to shut up about the dems already maybe if mccarthy still wanted to be speaker he shouldnt have included the clause that lets one person put his job in jeopardy this is his own damn fault you want a bipartisan solution start voting for jeffries and this can wrap up real quick
why are they only voting once a day they need to get to work
holy shit these callers
all those people who were adamant that jordan was going to win this in one vote are nowhere to be found

who knew that an unpopular hack would have a tough time winning an election outside of his gerrymandered district

that makes 16 failed republican attempts at finding a speaker  16 maybe they should just work with democrats so they can keep the government open
they are so toxic anyone they put up just gets to wait for 40 rnds of voting to figure it out
i wish i could be paid to clown around with the whole worlds economy at stake as hilarious as this all is its just as frightening
they should all not be paid until they have a new speaker
jim jordan is a traitor and fuck the gop
mccarthy got exactly what he deserved he didnt have enough republican support to pass the 45 day budget extension thanks to the hateful eight so he worked with dems to pass the measure after getting the measure passed he publicly blamed the dems for the shit show that the republicans are running and then he expected dems to support him when his own party decided to oust him thats hysterical 

however jim jordan isnt fit to sit in any position of responsibility i wouldnt trust that sa enabler to walk my dog 

its rich that the candidate supported by the minority party in the house has gotten more votes for speaker than any candidate from the majority party

the republican party is hopelessly fractured unwilling to forward legislation supported by a majority of the citizenry and incapable of governing 

when the shut down our government furlough federal workers destroy our credit and tank the stock market these bozos will still collect a paycheck
watching the fox news propagandists get pissed off at republicans reminds me of an abusive partner emotionally abusing their mate 

remember everyone fox news has been stoking this division for 25 years now fox news and the whole right wing media machine are a huge reason why our government is so dysfunctional right now 

it goes back years from rush limbaugh rest in hell to the hatemongers of today matt walsh candace owens ben shapiro etc rwmm has and continues to berate the democratic party turn on fox news and we are going to hear their anchors blame dems for everything and anything and demand republicans dont work with them 

republicans have decided to bow down to their wacko demands and now here we are republicans have become the whipping partner for fox news even though they did pretty much everything rupert murdoch and the other goons demanded  the gop party absolutely deserves blame here but i feel like people should take a look at fox news  the rest of them as well yes we have a first amendment but something has to give here or chaos will only continue
jordan deserves this humiliation the republican party deserves this humiliation  these are not serious people
lol at gaetz sending out fundraising emails accusing jordan of working with dems god this republican crabs in a bucket is really entertaining
httpswwwthreadsnetjefftiedrichpostcyjfmy4xwwpigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq

 jim jordan now has more failed speaker votes than he has failed insurrections
is gym jordan gonna start putting horse heads in peoples beds now unless they vote for him
so what now blame the democrats and 
jordan is toast  but hes too much of a fucking asshole to admit defeat  so hell just continue to bully bully attack attack  this is getting more ridiculous by the day
well this has been a shitshow as everyone predicted

one thing ive wondered about is whether the political capital gym jordan matt gaetz and so on blew on this is going to affect them individually and the freedom caucus going forward which gaetz isnt a member of iirc but i mean come on

jordan is in a surgically gerrymandered district that he can probably win until hes dead and gaetzs district is basically in alabama so hes not going anywhere but i wonder if republicans might just get fed up and railroad both of their asses  its been rumored that gaetzs aspirations are focused on the governors mansion in florida so id imagine his bullshit would probably play well there
ii am honestly surprised a freedom caucus member is even up for a speakership given how few they are and how much chaos they cause becuase i bet if they get control they remove the 1 vote rule to remove the speaker and then hold them all hostage
where are all the people who were absolutely sure he would win the first vote

not so sure about yourselves now

thats 15 failed republican attempts to elect a speaker for this session they are an absolute joke
id be satisfied with any noninsurrectionist republican who wont shut down the government will support ukraine and will agree to hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry if republicans can put up someone like that and agree to give them over 50 support the dems can all vote present and let them own it
httpsxcomjakeshermanstatus1714641411167957494s46tukr1tshxveunp4_vn5gzrw

punch bowl news

 good morning heres what were hearing this morning

 jordan will go to the floor around 11 for a second ballot all signals indicate he will lose support

 so next steps

 joyce a huge chunk of the center of the conference wants to make speaker pro tem patrickmchenry permanent this would require 217 votes no way around that 

 dems seem open  as maxpcohenheatherscope  have reported that has been reflected in my convos as well

 but  the q is do house rs want another speaker candidate to give this thing a go

 those who rs are watching mike johnson jodey arrington mark green and kevin hern 

 most republicans want to end this circus

 none of these candidates will get 217 that much is clear from my reporting
for a sense of timing yesterday went

1200 start of session

1242 quorum established nominations begin

1255 appointment of tellers voting begins

153 voting ends announcement of results

so the actual vote would be in 40 minutes with similar timing
it really boggles my mind that this is the best republicans can put up for house you may or may not agree with peloisi and her politics but she was an extremely effective speaker and not an extremist 
something that republicans cannot seem to find within their party
if the speaker protempore holds the gavel to the sky and proclaims by the power of greyskull he gets the full powers of the speaker

its in the constitution on the back somewhere
cspan callers absolutely never disappoint
these cspan republican callers are completely nuts im not surprised but damn
this 17 year old is the most articulate caller of the day the cspan guy is keeping her on the line as long as he can to prevent more crazies
love how the cspan guys like wow a high school calling lets get into this

i suppose you would when youre in that job
matt gaetz is a hero

refuses to elaborate and leaves

yesterday i said jordan is likely using intimidation tactics against the holdouts family a lot of people commented he wouldnt stoop that low

today its revealed he was threatening don bacons wife on the phone yikes
deleted
i love that democrats are straight up clowning on gym
its kind of funny that if jordan wins and you want to talk about a republican speaker involved in a wrestlingbased sexual abuse scandal youd have to specify which one
aguilar brought receipts and jokes
aguilar came into the ring with a chair on hand straight up called gyms lack of a record out
atleast aguilar has new talking points in general it seems also hes doing a good job not hyping jeffries but nailing jordans balls to the wall as well as the republicans
when republicans clap for jordan it sounds like a bar clapping for a drunk dude who just murdered war pigs on karaoke   


when hakeem gets applause it sounds like genuine support lol
lets get some of that dark brandon energy in the democratic caucus
this is the vote that never ends

yes it goes on and on my friends

republicans started fucking around not knowing what it was

and theyll continue finding out forever just because
republicans america first

us citizens yeah so better fund social security wic vets and other programs for the people

republicans we meant israel first america never

fin
alright bacon held next up is chavezderemer

so far hes net lost 2 votes from this same place in the vote count yesterday
jordan wont even hit 200 weak
gym jordan being in contention for speaker is an affront to every survivor of sexual abuse the man is an enabler of sa and he should be fucking shunned not empowered and elevated
deleted
this is a point where in parliamentary systems you get an early election

majority party has clearly lost the majority and there seemingly is no road to a compromise or a coalition

not sure what can even happen here this is completely unprecedented in us right
fucking lol john boehner sends his regards
representative john james of michigan appears to have voted for the macomb county public works commissioner
why did the democrats do this  s
ive never been so invested in a roll call in my life im here for the chaos
at some point jeffries must have crushed the record for the number of times being the top vote getter in a speaker vote
boehner just got a vote ill throw my hat in the ring
still makes me wonder how bad things were for scalise for him to not even bring his nomination to the floor
former speaker of the house dr george santos with a vote of confidence in jim jordan
it astounds me that these clowns get paid six figures work a few hours a day at best then still cant be bothered to vote
mchenry shushing the house 
jeffries gained a vote 

jordan lost 2  

curb your enthusiasm theme plays
o they fixed it that would have been wild if a republican voted for jefferies
how could democrats do this to us  mccarthy muttering to himself in the capitol shitter
as usual jordan couldnt win without pippen not my goat sadly
nbc

 republican defectors are becoming more free with their nominations with rep mike kelly offering a vote for former speaker of the house john boehner who led the chamber from 20112015

well that would restore an ounce of sanity to the republican caucus but hell still have to deal with matty and his ilk of the freedumb caucus

how can anyone describe the gop as a legitimate political party at this point
can someone please call cspan and talk to these republicans about being fucking idiots over jim jordan no not all americans want jim jordan being speaker of the house are you off your rocker jeffries got more votes than jordan ever did clearly the people in the house want him
man the difference between the republican and democratic callers is really striking isnt it

d
is mchenry a rat fucker  i dont hate his vibe but you can never tell with these guys
more recess than kindergarten
remember that the treason caucus is called that for a reason they really do oppose democracy so endless votes to no resolution is the outcome they want
seems like jeffries would make most people happy the rs can spin it as we had to give in to the left so we could support israel they could also make ads for election season about retaking the house who cares if they gave it away that doesnt matter when it comes to messaging to their base 
gop used obstruct everything and blame democrats

its super effective
hes a caaahmmyounisst

i dont care if they elect satan

ive heard stereotypes about staten island and she is proving it
deleted
the entire republican call in line is an argument against free speech and democracy
i wish cspan had cameras in the house like they did for my kevins 15 rounds that was must see tv
cant wait to see how theyll blame the dems for this
gollums gonna gollum
people who want to blame democrats are just bad actors
hes literally still saying that i just dont get it he could have his gavel back in one hour by making a deal for the dems to vote present and likely have to give very little in return basically just allow the house to function without a bunch of the nonsense and in the process hed be telling the maga lunatics whove had him under their heel the past 9 months to fuck off for good 

something in me always wants to believe that these people are just in it for themselves but also not morons yet they continue to be the biggest morons mccarthy could still be speaker without the matt gaetz monkey on his back i get the threats from trump and the maga voting block but at a certain point have some balls and just let them cry about it
possibly a dumb move c 2023 the republican party
youll never work in this town again

thats your qualification for the job your goon squad

yes i also have a pretty intimidating stare right

uhhuh this has been great dont reach out to us well call you never
to be fair he likely threatened closer to 50 20 of them refused
to anyone reading this reminder that that random caller could be you
just in case you havent seen this gem i was just reminded of it

couch commander featuring obama and boehner chilling and talking about postpolitical life 

 httpsmyoutubecomwatchvoidegn4js40
thats a pretty good dig

boehner was run out by the loonies because he gasp compromised and worked with obama

well played
i both love and hate this circus
finally he did something in the house
nah theyre blind almost all of my republican friendsfamily have already swallowed the fox news pill that this is 100 democrats fault
imagine that there was an aocberniewhoever splitting off votes from nancy pelosi in january 2019 and democrats were whining that the gop wont help them by voting for pelosi

edit ok not bernie hes a senator brain fart
especially annoying because democrats themselves are happy to help the gop just has to put out a reasonable candidate
i want to see jordan get ousted anyone else
best news ive heard in the last 10 minutes  
  
fuck gymothy
you should add that mccarthy got booted precisely because when he was first trying to get the votes to be speaker he chose to negotiate with the same maga crowd instead of working out a powersharing deal with democrats and one of the outcomes was the  ability for a single rep to initiate the exact procedure that got him removed

at this point it really evokes the idea of the gop being downright insane trying the exact same thing but expecting a different outcome
youre exactly right everything about this is 100 on republicans they have the majority they can do anything they want without dems help so its not dems fault that they cant actually govern
theyre like toddlers who are mad we wont let them eat dog food and piss all over the house so they hold their breath and threaten to pass out while blaming democrats for them being covered in piss and choking themselves
140180 go with the flow highest bidder republicans

ftfy
0 moderate republicans  if there were theyd make a deal with democrats
id bet my left tit that its largely performative rather than grounded in any actually strongly held beliefs

but if you bring the fact that its unfair to other religions the diehards will try to convince you that america is a christian country and if you dont like it leave
the 8 that voted mccarthy out have no interest in governing in the first place of course there was no plan to replace him they just want to be on tv and create chaos
i saw one jordan ally expects jordan will lose votes today
theres no way he can handle being speaker while he has a full mlb postseason schedule  you want the phillies star relief pitcher and hall of fane manager to just walk away from the team
democrats gave mccarthy every opportunity to save his own job  he was an awful speaker hes an awful person and he was offering nothing no reason for democrats to save him
lawler is a freedom caucus fuck face and for some reason msnbc has been parading him around like he is some bipartisan hero fuck him
guy was a  total fucking scumbag but id be there smoking with him right now i could
theyre too busy posting memes and babylon bee articles to notice probably and trying to devise new ways to own the libs sothe usual
theres a thread now and the top comment is why are house republicans so fucking useless

they are so close to getting it
i saw comments saying that this is the democrats shitshow lol absolutely seething over there
both parties suck but ive also voted straight ticket republican for the last 40 years
people who are actually ideologically dedicated extremist freaks and not just pretending to trick the yokels in their home districts are winning elections getting major committee assignments and attaining leadership positions
boehner was always a very reasonable governing partner  he just had to deal with the rise of the tea party unfortunately  he did what he could to keep them marginal at the time
boehner would get to the podium say get fucked and walk out
its so frustrating im glad theyre standing firm so far

after the budget bill took a while to pass mccarthy immediately turned around and blamed the democrats for the delay

i hate this idea that its democrats fault for everything and that republicans making any sort of compromise is somehow off the table but democrats are expected to make compromises at every turn

if you want dems to help keep mccarthy in he could have done literally anything to make the house more bipartisan he could have offered some bill votes some committee chairs heck he could have given them even a fraction of what he offered the maga monsters

until republicans demonstrate a willingness to meet in the middle there should be no expectation that democrats will change their vote
ugh im actually impressed
goddamnit this is beautiful
for once i approve of gop devious tactics
the recent talks of expanding the pro tempores powers temporarily probably takes a lot of pressure off the holdouts too 

and yeah  time isnt exactly a good thing for him he might whittle the numbers a little but if he doesnt get it today or get really close i could easily see him bleeding support versus gaining it
jeffries has the most speaker votes in us history despite never having been speaker
better than that asshole from ohio actually winning this vote
why is it up to his unelected ass
ok good but please do the vote anyway so i can laugh at him some more
wonder if the lost support comes from it going public about the threats and bullying coming from supporters at his behest
i dont know how anyone with a conscience can even vote republican let alone be a sworn member of the gqp
refuse to use twitter anymore
none  the gop values tribalism more than governance and thats not being snarky thats just how they operate
why do dems have to come over to help republicans  why not have republicans help democrats and elect jefferies
and the d fringe like aoc want to accomplish something  the r fringe like gaetz just want to burn it down for either higher office or a 7 figure salary from fox
reverse momentumprevents him from looking like hes picking up any support and potentially fractures the shaky coalition he got from the 50 no votes originally
they want him to drop out but they dont have someone to unify around so theyre killing any progress he will make
really 1 vote a day lazy ass republicans
thats unfair

hes also having his goons threaten peoples wives
hes going to not certify the 2024 election so that vp harris can pick trump as the winner s
no because the freedom caucus themselves dont know what their actual agenda is
having the vote when you know you dont have the numbers is incredibly stupid having the vote once per day is the only smart thing theyve done in the past two days
washington post saying the same

 rep jim jordan rohio told reporters there would be no further votes wednesday but he expects another vote would be held on the house floor thursday
john boehner hitting a bong while watching this on cspan   


nah fuck that lol
youd think then that the republicans could just vote mccarthy back in since well if the democrats were the only ones to blame for him being ousted
it would be political suicide as others have said but we should just take a moment to step back and appreciate how ludicrous that is the only reason this is such a hard problem for the gop is that their house majority is so narrow its really astounding that some sort of consensus moderate candidate hasnt ascended to the speakership because thats how this situation is designed to play out on paper really speaks to just how toxic our polarized political situation has gotten
there are only 18 rs in a lean deven pvi district of them the below are the ones not voting for jordan

 bacon

 chavezderemer

 desposito

 garcia

 james

 kiggans

 lawler

so they really need to get 5 of 7 no one in a lean r district would flip and i imagine those still supporting jordan unless they are a part of the coalition against him delaying their no votes in swinglean d districts are not likely to flip
dems wont vote for anyone except jeffries nor should they this is a gop problem and they need to fix it themselves or 5 of them commit political suicide and vote for jeffries
ralphie i cant put my arms down
yeah im wondering the same thing did they go home or it is still possible to have another vote

edit ok msnbc said they went home and that they have an option to have another vote tomorrow at noon but are not sure theyll do it yet
im hoping some republicans start voting present just to screw with him and then miscalculate and accidentally lower the threshold enough to select jeffries
why wont the democrats just vote for a guy who hates them and refuses to work with them to get anything done
i do the love the blamecasting if only democrats would vote for an insurrectionist wed get back to not passing a budget
yes he has an r next to his name
they keep expecting democrats to vote for a seditionist that means any democrat asked on camera should be quick to turn that into how bout you guys vote for jeffries instead hes already got more votes than jimbo
wuts accountability precious
you gotta remember that mccarthy was literally on the phone with trump on january 6th screaming to send help and only a few weeks later he went groveling to mar a lago  he then proceeded to back the narrative that it was a peaceful rally  then to get the speaker job he literally gave a few hardliners in his party every single concession they wanted including a 1 person no confidence vote

the word spinless doesnt really cut it  mccarthy is literally jello  not one shred of integrity  his one and only goal is to remain in congress i suspect that he is terrified that making another deal with democrats would cost him his seat long term  even if hes enjoying jordan not having enough votes he still votes for jordan every time
thank you for reminding me of this gem its right up there for me with the buzzfeed video of obama upon failing to dip a cookie in a glass of milk saying thanks obama
and the people that ran boehner out werent those the tea partiers  whove since either been run out of congress or absorbed by the freedom caucus
ask them  if there was infighting among the democrats would it be the republicans fault nope still also democrats fault got it
i told my dad that regardless of why the vote is happening it doesnt change the fact that 200 republican reps voted for an insurrectionist
i want to see jordan get thrown into a central intelligence agency black site but to each their own
that was my read as well a lot of those that got the hard sell over the weekend gave him support for x number of votes or as long as it looked like he was close
say what you will about nancy pelosi she knew how to fucking count
this is really infuriating at least with mccarthy they voted several times a day even though it was futile other than the weekends they kept voting until they decided on a speaker the rs need to give it up on pond scum jim and start doing their jobs and pick someone else they cant whip the votes for him that much is clear but to not even vote tomorrow is asinine and irresponsible
heads i win tails you lose"
im elaina plott calabro a staff writer at the atlantic i profiled kamala harris for our november issue ask me anything,"hey reddit i sat down with kamala harris at her home in april to learn more about why the democratic party and the biden administration have been reluctant to embrace her readiness to step in as president

the possibility that an incumbent might die in office has not been a significant issue in most us elections during the past half century but given president joe bidens age many are wondering if harris is prepared for the presidencyand few people seem to believe she is i explain through my reporting what theyre missing

for the past eight years i have reported extensively on national politics and congress ive traveled with harris to atlanta new york los angeles and reno nevada as well as to africa for my reporting you can read my story herehttpswwwtheatlanticcommagazinearchive202311kamalaharrisvicepresidency2024electionbidenage675439 and an interview about writing this feature herehttpswwwtheatlanticcomnewslettersarchive202310kamalaharrisnarrative675616 you can browse my previous political reporting herehttpswwwtheatlanticcomauthorelainaplott

edit thank you so much for your thoughtful questions today i enjoyed taking you behind the scenes of my reporting on vice president kamala harris as the 2024 presidential election approaches i will continue reporting on harris and the biden administration please feel free to send thoughts and tips to eplotttheatlanticcom until next time","thank you so much elaina for joining us and answering the communitys questions the moderators are choosing to lock this thread to optimize viewing for posterity and preserve moderation resources
the vp is a terrible position  it makes everyone look bad no matter how qualified they get the issues and speeches that the president doesnt want to touch or be associated with the top gets the credit for anything good the administration does i honestly wonder why anyone would really want the job unless there is a very real chance of someone dying in office and the less national base before they get the job the worse they tend to appear think dan quayle barring death of the president its rare for a vp to step immediately into the presidency 

my question is do you think harris would have been better served staying in the senate where she could have been more visible building a national profile on her own
deleted
what is a personal quality of hers that you feel would help her on the campaign trail if shed let it come out more my personal take on kamala is that shes good at putting up this generally inoffensive carefully tweaked political persona but theres nothing about that publicfacing image that really endears me to her the same way you get with firebrands like aoc or jasmine crockett
what projects has she been working on in her time as vp doesnt seem like she gets as much coverage as prior vps
please discuss the turnover amongst her staff and the perception shes an incompetent manager  leader
given how hated she is among the right and how much dislikeapathy there is for her in the center and even on the left is there any way she could realistically win a presidential election
how can someone with close to two thousand marijuana convictions ever expect to be popular in the democratic party
what strategies is harris deploying to improve her standing among millennialsgen zers given that these will have to be a core constituency for her to have a chance in the primary
its worth noting that she spent her first two years basically stuck in washington dc serving as president of the senate and tiebreaking votes  shes part of the reason biden confirmed so many judges in his first two years
does she have a speech coach she sounds very condescending and a good speech coach could greatly improve her likeability and image
why did the administration think it practical to assign her the border crisis as some sort of pet project why did they think that would help her branding
one of kamalas greatest skillsets legal understandings as californias former attorney general could be very informative to the biggest scandal of our era donalds multiple indictments from his alleged broad corruption yet it is also a topic the biden administration is sensitive to reference or act on to understandably avoid political bias

how has kamala navigated this sensitivity and carefulness  has kamala shown any influence in how the biden administration has navigated this balancing act  and for the 2020 election largely being a rejection of donalds corruption what impact should she be expected to have as a former state ag and current vp in addressing this alleged but likely corruption
why do you think she is so resistant to taking any assignments that play to her experience in criminal justice
do you think shes the future of the democratic party or do you think shell drop out of sight after her vice presidency run is over
what are the vice presidents opinions about legalizing marijuana and addressing the harms that she participated in when enforcing the war on drugs
has anyone seriously spoken to her about standing down for 2024  what about mr biden 
hi elaina

it seems like the obama era unearthed a lot of the hidden racism in the country and then the 20156 election cycle unearthed a lot of mysogyny still we came close to having a hillary administration  do you think that there will ever be a black woman as potus
what do you think is the best thing kamala has done as vp so far
is the vp considering running for president after the second term is over
i have found her very disappointing as a vp and i thought she had great potential 

what happened to her really working on border issues and what has she been doing is she not doing much or why would the biden administration not be advertising her accomplishments are we the american public missing something
i explain through my reporting what theyre missing

who are you working for then i thought the press held the powerfuls feet to the fire not the publics

to quote amy klobuchar in a dnc primary debate said to pete buttigieg are you calling me dumb

the democratic voters thoroughly rejected her in the primary do you think they we were all dumb and need to be reeducated

she pushed through a truancy program in ca that ended with parents of chronically ill children arrested when they didnt meet the quota of inperson school attendance

she asked theatrical questions of kavanaugh that sounded absolutely intriguing the one about the kasowitz benson torres law firm as if she knew some bombshell but it went absolutely nowhere

she proudly stated over and over again that she represented the obama coalition which was code for saying she would win based on demographicsnot ideas

i reject her simply because she has no ideas on economic justice and like biden is a shapeshifter who will embrace any position to maximize the chance of political power

im not missing anything politicians who think the status quo is representative of the greatest country on earth and the history of the world as biden just said this week on 60 minutes are missing something its embarrassing to see the fealty and people apologizing for them im supporting marianne williamson in the primary if i have to vote for bidenharris in the general again i guess i will but its with holding my nose very tight the smugness they have when being so incompetent is grating and theyre not helped by a media who like you tells us we just dont understand well enough
kamala is a cop and would be a terrible president why does the democratic party insist on shoving the most unlikeable people down the publics throat
i know this isnt super relevant to the post but


how do you see things shaking out with the speakership  also how do you see the next month playing out for the house
harris is like hillary strong women than scares conservative and indie voters no personality but more than able to run a country
a lot more small candidates are moving towards common sense policies what are her views on that too many politicians are focusing on big picture problems while little things are getting neglected
does she know she knows that she is viewed as an albatross around biddens neck
is she open to a replacement for somebody  more viable like stacey abraham or gavin newson or she reflexible will tag that idea as racist sexist
removed
if biden were to compete two full terms what do you imagine harris would do next

she seems unlikely to ever win a presidential nomination without being subbed in but also seems way too young to leave the upper tier of politics
over the course of my reporting a handful of harriss allies told me they wish she had done just that youll recall the name she was making for herself as she deftly questioned trump cabinet picks and supreme court nominees some confided in me their belief that had she remained in the senate and continued to stand out on the judiciary committee as well as get more comfortable on the national stage her first goaround in the white house might have resonated somewhat more positively at the same time when youre asked to be your partys presidential nominee youre not going to say no
joe bidens valueadd to the obama white house was unmistakable because obama had spent only a few years in washington before becoming president biden  a creature of capitol hill  became an immediate and essential liaison to congress by contrast when harris came into office it wasnt so clear what role she would serve for biden so much of her first two years as vice president was about figuring out this role rather than leaning into one in the way biden was able biden genuinely values harriss input on major decisions and he likes for her to be in the room but the white house struggled to answer me when i asked about times her voice was essential to the administrations decisionmaking
thanks so much for this question  your personal take matches that of so many voters ive interviewed in the past year harris is an incredibly warm person and someone who can be funny at her own expense these were two qualities i never would have suspected having just observed her from afar but quickly emerged as i got to know her oneonone harriss tremendous riskaversion often prevents her from showing herself on stage in the way that her family and friends see her in private her future success as a politician will depend largely i think on her ability to overcome this
it depends on how committed democratic party leadership is to seeing her as bidens successor so much of ones success as a vp  a tremendously nebulous role  hinges on the west wings commitment to elevating himher before the public in harriss first two years as vp biden and the party more broadly did very little to present her as an essential governing partner harriss success in 2028 will depend in no small part on whether her partys leadership wants her to have it
thats my question was hilary clinton the most qualified presidential candidate in history without question but democratic leaders remained myopic regarding her electability among general voters harris seems to spark that same reaction  is it fair no but democrats have to get better at choosing candidates who can carry electoral votes in a perfect world clinton would have won handily over trump alas we do not live in that perfect world
removed
its a great question and the impetus for it helps illuminate harriss struggles in her own presidential bid in 2019 her career as a prosecutor putting aside even the specifics is no longer the neutraltopositive asset it might have been in her party even a decade ago on the campaign trail she struggled  and ultimately failed  to reconcile her professional background with the high skepticism her partys base felt toward law enforcement if that skepticism endures into 2028 shell face the same challenge
you didnt ask me but biden did far more damage to that particular constituency and he relies on them today for good reason he changed his politics i guarantee that harris will endorse federal legalization today

the current views on marijuana are very current among consistent voters
since early september harris has been on a college tour to discuss what her team calls key issues that disproportionately impact young people across the country but harris has been speaking on college campuses across the country from the early days of her vice presidency  really from the moment covid restrictions lightened enough to allow her travel having gone to a few of those events i can say that she resonates remarkably well with students and gen z particularly when discussing the climate crisis shes been an effective spokesperson for the administration in this respect ive never seen her connect with an audience more clearly than she did when discussing climate change at georgia tech earlier this year
definitely one of the biden admins major blunders basically threw her under the bus with an unwinnable assignment
i certainly dont think she will drop out of sight barring any disaster she will be the democratic partys presumptive presidential nominee in 2028 the question of course  and again so much of this will depend on what happens in the time until then  will be how emboldened people like gavin newsom pete buttigieg and gretchen whitmer feel to challenge her these are the sorts of conversations already happening among prominent democratic donors and one concern i hear frequently among harriss allies is that she is not engaging proactively enough in those conversations tldr the future of the democratic party is hers to lose
i do its difficult of course to say how soon that might happen racism and misogyny have inherently figured into kamala harriss low approval ratings but what i think sometimes gets lost in this narrative is just how many in the democratic party  and even outside it  have yearned for harris to succeed in the eight months i reported this story i spoke with voters from moderate republicans and independents to very progressive democrats and almost all of them seemed willing to give her the benefit of the doubt precisely because they wanted the first woman and black woman in this role to thrive kamala harris has the ability to unite a pretty powerful coalition of voters if she decides to use it
defining best here as most effective i think harris has been most effective as a spokesperson for reproductive rights this is an issue that biden himself has said hes not comfortable embracing but harris has been able to champion this issue in a moment when naturally many moderatetoprogressive americans have been looking to the white house for leadership i think her outspokenness in general and active campaigning in red and blue states alike in particular played no small role in the democratic partys success in the 2020 midterms its difficult to overstate the pressure harris faced in advance of the midterms to change her tune  people forget how insistent the pundit class was that the economy would rule voters concerns and that a red wave was imminent but she stood her ground  because she had been spending so much time on the ground with voters themselves unlike your typical cable news analyst she understood the salience of reproductive rights ultimately of course her instincts proved spoton
that is if p biden makes it through unscathed
these are great questions the latter in particular helped inform my decision to pursue this story in the first place  it was something i found voters from all across the political spectrum wondering part of the disappointment about her progress or apparent lack thereof on the border has been fueled by a misunderstanding about the assignment biden actually gave her he tasked harris with working with central american leaders to alleviate the poverty violence and other conditions that tend to cause many migrants to flee north in the first place  youve probably heard this referred to as the root causes element of border policy this is what biden took on for obama during his years as vp and its the sort of assignment in which success is tough to measure in the shortterm  


but the biden administration itself is partly to blame for why youre asking this question in the first place when republicans advertised harris falsely as the administrations border czar biden and the democratic party more broadly did little to correct the record
im supporting marianne williamson in the primary

and immediately you lose any credibility you might have had

heres why you shouldnt support this person who i dont agree with  instead im supporting a complete nut job in a primary against an incumbent president
harris record of punitive marijuana convictions and an almost complete lack of charisma has made her into one of the most unpopular vps in living memory not her gender race or rightwing reporting
this was a well crafted joke
she is not a cop 

 in the criminal justice system the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders these are their stories
i recall that prior to the last election she did some tiktoks showing her at home with family cooking and doing normal people stuff  she was warm and funny and personable and im really critical of the way she presents publicly i thought that was a great way to get her personal side across especially to younger people
well yeah theyve been keeping her in a closet for a reason but at some point thats going to become counter productive
it wouldnt be the first time the dnc suppressed the will of its constituents to prop up an unpopular centrist
if it seemed like she would win id imagine theyd have elevated the bejesus out of her in fact i have long suspect biden doesnt even want to be there he probably worries about his age more than i do
she did get the popular vote 
i think people were more accepting than what general sentiment may show  if not for the mess that is the electoral college  history wouldve been much different
its funny you bring up hillary because of the razor thin margins that she lost on i dont think its crazy that actually getting a vp that appealed better the turnout math turns out differently in one of michigan north carolina georgia wisconsin  no one really gave a shit about tim kaine

of course there were other variables too that could have flipped the script such as comey not throwing her under the bus but at least this one was 100 in her control and she fumbled it
keeping her out of the spotlight definitely lends credence to the notion that she was only on the ticket because shes a black female her record as a prosecutor definitely turns off a lot of leftists and her ahem demographics would almost certainly unite the right against her 

so what now
that was my thinking too at the time
but on a national level newsom is more popular even with some fox news viewers and i can even see whitmer winning the next primary before harris just because in the past the former vp having a lock on the nomination was a thing doesnt mean its going to be the case now she has done nothing to get voters to like her more if anything i think being vp has harmed her chances
is there any kind of ground up support for kamala as a candidate or is this just party inertia keeping her going ive never run into anyone in real life thats excited to see more kamala
thats a ridiculous statement the 2028 dem nomination is not hers to lose
dont you think that depends on how 2024 goes she will still be important as the former vp if biden loses but very different from if they win and she is running as the sitting vp
awesome ty

how was reno seems like an interesting battleground with the increased primary importance and everything going on there nevadas sparse population probably really magnifies those urban centers
 he tasked harris with working with central american leaders to alleviate the poverty violence and other conditions 

can you elaborate on how thats been going
in what way is she a nut job

her religion

biden literally believes he eats the body and drinks the literal blood of a person who may or may not have existed and died over 2000 years ago

marianne williamsons platform is nearly identical to bernie sanders and shes razor sharp and is an american history whiz
httpsyoutubegp3muutmxnksis6p5qlvtthja7bzv
but thats the point the popular vote is fine and dandy but means nothing if you cant capture the electoral college democrats would always win if we went by the popular vote we need candidates who can win electoral votes clinton was a phenomenal candidate but i knew in august 2016 shed never capture the electoral college
but kaine was very popular on the campaign trail  im not sure who she couldve chose that wouldve made a difference
she still polls 80 among the black community especially with older females which have the highest turnout within it i dont see it as a poor electoral strategy i definitely think her weaknesses get overweighted and strengths underweighted inside the reddit bubble as an electoral football i dont think it will work as 2028 presidential candidate but certainly makes sense as a foil to bidens weaknesses electorally when states like ga nc are so important right now
her incoherent speech doesnt help her either
i still dont get why they chose her as vp she isnt a value add in any sort of way other than ticking the box of woman theres a reason why her performance was so laughable in primaries
there is a lot of party deference to the white house 

there are already better options for 2028 but harris will absolutely have the advantage and the race will be hers to lose
from the perspective of the party it is the party can never fail it can only be failed i dont know which democrat id prefer be the nominee but i know it isnt harris right now i think big gretch is probably my choice but that may be because her negatives havent had enough coverage to sway me away
ideal world  we should just get rid of the electoral college
i genuinely dont think theres a single state she would have won if she picked someone that energized ga or mi over kaine
id vote for her and proudly but i think that for a woman to break this barrier youll need a onceinageneration communicator another kennedy not that one another obama another fdr or reagan i dont think there is one of any flavour on the national stage right now
youre probably right but my point was keeping her out of the spotlight while expedient up to a point i guess is not going to help in the long run
incoherent speech
id vote for her as well in the general but youre right shes lacking a certain charisma
yes there are many clips of kamala harris talking before crowds where she says things that dont make sense often in ways that make her seem like shes either very tired or kind of drunk"

bipartisan standing ovation for democrat mary peltola who just voted for jeffries this was peltolas first vote since returning from alaska after the death of her husband

for anybody wondering about that last round of clapping
from nbc
a gop lawmaker who is a jordan backer just said they are aware of 5 to 6 republicans who say they will not support jordan on the second ballot after voting for him on the first

that means jordans list of defectors grows rather than shrinks on a second round
this ending with fifteen failed votes only for mccarthy to end up speaker again in a week would be the funniest goddamn thing in american political history


 the real story here isnt the number of republicans opposing jim jordan but that jim jordans support for speaker went from 99 just one week ago to likely more than 200 today the vast majority of republicans are normalizing an insurrectionist  we should all be very alarmed

the republican party deserves to implode and burn itself down 


i have no sympathy for any one of the members of the republican party about anything 

you refuse to govern this country you are the reason our country is so divided you waste the taxpayers money constantly on bogus investigations and again refusing to actually govern while screaming you are the party that cares the most about fiscal matters 

you scream you are the party of christianity even though you are trying to elect a speaker who either says he is david duke without the baggage or someone who covered up sexual abuse and provoked an insurrection on our capitol you are also trying to elect a president who couldnt even name 1 not a single bible verse raped 13 yo katie johnson with jeffrey epstein inappropriately touches his daughter

you scream you are the party that cares for the military yet you are trying to elect a draft dodger a person who openly mocks members of our service including ones who have lost their life defending this country 

i will never ever ever take you or anyone associated with your party seriously ever again 

you are damaging this country beyond repair and i will never forgive you 

to every single republican representative and voter sincerely fuck off
i know its customary but a prayer to start out a government function rubs me the wrong way
im gym jordan and ive literally not accomplished anything in my 16 years in congress 

repubs thats our man
8590 of rs are aok with fascism as long as its their side that will benefit  no more democracy and fair elections no benefits for the majority of citizens and tons of hoorah nationalism and hatefueled culture wars to keep the rubes voting them in
its wild that theres a nonzero chance america will empower the gop to keep the house take the senate and take the white house

after seeing the gop control the house for 2 years and the white house under trump they might actually try to go back to it already 

i understand that the system is rigged in their favor but that it is close enough to be riggable is revolting

this country is so damn frustrating hopefully in a decade or so as generational counts change the imbalance will be resolvable so long as we dont give up now
in first vote for speaker of the house democrat hakeem jeffries defeats republican jim jordan 212200

this is fucking ridiculous  i cannot believe america even has a traitorous piece of shit even eligible for 3rd in line for the most powerful position on earth

edit  sorry i was corrected 2nd in line even worse  i kind of included current president my bad
farleft government

these cspan people are absolutely crazy if laws are stalled so be it we have too many lolll they dont realize how stalled laws and resolutions will end up affecting them personally down the road
i guess i was wrong  those moderate  republicans do have a spine  wonder why they dont use it more often
this is the weakest shit i ever seen the man loses the vote more than mccarthy and then peace out for the day 

if gym jordan cant get 217 today after the pressure campaign from the previous days how the hell will he convince people to vote for him tomorrow weak fucking sauce 

such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why the democrats even bring the thunder  why hakeem jeffries even brings the thunder
i love this story from cnn

kevin mccarthy  who was ousted as house speaker earlier this month  has been counseling ohio rep jim jordan on strategy for his own speakership bid according to multiple sources familiar with the situation    
jordan and mccarthy were seen huddling on the floor tuesday and jordan after losing a floor vote on the first ballot decamped to the former speakers suite   
one source noted that mccarthy  who went through 15 rounds of voting before securing the speakers gavel in january  has been there before

dumb gym is taking strategy advice from the least effective speaker in the history of the us  classic republican move
whenever i watch the cspan livestream im reminded how much being a congressperson involves just standing around waiting and bullshitting
jordan is down by a lot more than i expected already

i guess the maga terrorists are going to be busy issuing death threats all afternoon
so rs said no vote until they had 217 in conference  gym fucked over the 2 and immediately tried to strongarm for a floor vote   
  
and now he looks like himself a raging loudmouth fool
cspan caller democrats bad

mam this is a wendys
john kasich on msnbc right now slamming dems for enjoying the repubs dysfunction suggesting they should be more yielding that jeffries should deal more and encourage his folks to vote for an r how about encouraging the few sane rs to deal with jeffries
i popped over to some conservative subs to see how people are taking this over there

i think my favorite bit was a debate over how democrats are only voting together because they are all brainwashed lol  not being able to elect a speaker is good  it means you arent brainwashed or something
appearing on cnn as the house recessed republican rep carlos giménez said he knows some republicans agreed to vote for jordan on the first round but will likely peel away after that

lmao what a fucking mess
i just spoke with christina bohannan a democrat who is challenging mariannette millermeeks in iowas first congressional district she views millermeekss vote for jordan as out of step with iowans in her district she notes that jordan has never voted for a farm bill which couldnt be more critical to iowa and that more than 60 percent of iowans reject his position in support of a nationwide abortion ban her comments are a reminder that democrats think the chaos and extremism on display in the house will help them win back control in 2024

iowas 1st is only r3
what a job show up for a couple of hours scroll through my phone vote when my name is called accomplish nothing leave work with nothing accomplished
get the fucking praying out of the damn government
someone is going to ask applause for peltola because her husband died in a plane crash recently
why would hunter bidens laptop allow this to happen
should republicans ever end up with a moderate speaker never forget that 200 republican house members thought voting jim jordan as speaker was a good idea
how can anyone believe republicans have the ability to govern at this point

this level of dysfunction is unsustainable yet i see no end in sight

they should be mortified at how inept they look but theyre so obsessed with making trump a dictator and oppressing citizens that all logic is gone
jordan will be the next speaker of the house and it will be a fucking disaster for the country  in addition to being trumps personal henchmen jordan is a fucking lunatic who has 0 interests in governing

jordan will push forward various culture wars undermining any investigations into jan 6th and likely push the govt into a shutdown  i have very little hope that we see anything resembling compromise from the house with such an extremists in charge
cspan caller as a lifelong democrraaaattt the republicans need to vote lock step for jordan oh please do they think theyre fooling anyone
im shocked gym jordan just didnt ignore those 20 votes and install himself as speaker guy has a history with not giving a fuck about consent
in an ideal world this would mean a leftleaning r would work with rightleaning ds and have a house session full of compromise and slow steps forward as we continue to improve the nation

but hey fuck an ideal world
exdc metro police officer michael fanone

 jim jordan is an insurrectionist who has no place being second in line to the presidency

 it absolutely disgusts me that extreme republicans could choose an insurrectionist and election denier as their leader
why is it so hard to get these people to show up on time to vote like brothers and sisters this is literally your job
not only does gym not get a majority he cant even manage a plurality and instead finishes 2nd

2nd place isnt enough for house speaker its only enough to win a presidential election
can i just say how satisfying it is to see jeffries receive more votes than jordan
on october 3 after his removal mccarthy initially stated that he would not seek the speakership again however on october 9 he indicated his willingness to be nominated the following day mccarthy changed his stance once more advising house republicans not to nominate him

oh good lord
its crazy how jordan makes mccarthy look like a moderate
 gop rep john james who voted for rep tom cole for house speaker on todays ballot said he would be open to supporting rep jim jordan in future rounds of voting saying he plans to speak with him later

so soft some of these holdouts are 100 doing this to get a modicum of attention before they relent
reminder we are paying the house of representatives more than 200000 today in salary for this nonsense
gym jordan  passed no bills in 16 years guess he is there for trump and to investigate hunter b penis on his computer
worth nothing the long serving gop house speaker was also a wrestling coach involved in abuse of his students

hastert used he told others about the abuse as a defense in a breach of contract a suit to over the hush money  special kind of awful
not going to be part of a coup httpsapnewscomhousespeakervoteliveupdates0000018b3ef1d13aa5affff977060000

a congressman who has opposed jordans quest for speakership from the start says the conference made a decision in january in backing kevin mccarthy and should stick to it

rep carlos gimenez of florida was among 20 republicans who voted for alternatives to jordan in tuesdays house speaker vote dooming his bid on the first round of balloting gimenez cast his vote for mccarthy who was ousted from the job two weeks ago

gimenez said we should go back to what we had he asked why would we change our horse in midstride

he added im not going to be a part of a coup
has anyone considered voting for jim gaffigan as a compromise candidate
republicans have really shoved a finger in their mouths ass and urethra at the same time

either you go back to mccarthy which would make this a big waste of time with egg on everyones face you go with jordan which hurts them in the general and means nothing gets passed or they make a deal with the democrats meaning whoever votes for it gets primaried resulting in a candiate that probably wont win a general
two weeks ago gop  mccarthy will stay speaker  oops scratch that

last week gop  trump could be speaker

last week gop mccarthy will be speaker again

last week gop  scalise will be speaker

last week gop  jordan will be speaker

today gop  uhhh dunno  we worked two whole hours today   well get back to you after a 20 hour nap
you dont have the votes

you dont have the votes  
  
youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes

at least i hope thats the case
two options

1 a shitshow now and gym is not elected
2 gym gets elected and we get a much longer shitshow
rumor is that if he doesnt make it across the threshold on the first vote that he will start losing converts

the recent flips can then say i voted for him but he didnt have the votes and we needed a better candidate
the fact this party would nominate gym jordan for speaker just shows oh irredeemable they truly are hes one of the absolute worst politicians in history hes evil hes antidemocratic and hes antiamerican i just cant believe they would support him total maskoff situation here the republican party is full on fascist
mary peltola dak is getting the applause to recognize her husbands death in a plane crash last month causing her to miss the vacate motion

 i personally know 5 will change their votes from yes to no on second round 
thats what they told me this will get worse one house member tells me just now
failed by 16 18 20 votes some staffers are saying there are other gop members that would switch to a no vote if this first round had failed

this is a larger gap then kevin had back in january this sad little insurrectionist doesnt get to play chief
the fact 200 republicans are ok with jordan is fucking terrifying
imagine the conversation happening right between gop members

you got members who are guaranteed lifetime appointments thanks to their gerrymandered seats lecturing people who won by slightest of margins in blue states about voting for gym jordan an extremist nutjob who covered up sexual abuse and tried overturning the election in 2020

these ads write themselves there are no moderates in this party and they are flat out lying about doing any sort of work to benefit anyone other than themselves
if jordan pulls this off they dont even have to make it about trump anymore next year the dems running ads about january 6 in swing districts with jordan as speaker is a pretty strong message
conservative callers on cspan have no idea how clueless and stupid they sound
air bud for speaker theres no rule a dog cant be speaker
so are the dems basically just waiting to be approached by a small group of pottytrained republicans to elect a moderate at this point
the same jordansupporters who refused to back scalise after republicans held a secret ballot nomination process and scalise won are the ones who are demanding that everyone in the republican caucus get behind jordan now
speaker of the house barack obama
i decided ive been pegged with the gavel enough for today tomorrow at 11 am is when i will present my anus again before god and country and hannity and trumptry

if they are delaying until tomorrow he may have actually lost some votes
deleted
 imagine being a reek like mccarthy where you just got removed and the same wannabe terrorists responsible for your ouster youre catering to them and voting for one 

jordan may not have officially voted to remove him but he 100 helped bring the chaos
i was just listening to the daily podcast about how he has been able to use essentially stochastic terrorism doxxing holdouts on twitter threatening them with consequences from the maga base etc as a way to flip the remaining republicans who refuse to vote for him we need to find a way to put an end to this shit
so can we finally put to rest the term moderate republican dragons are more likely to exist
gym jordan is one of my most hated gqp members in congress  i think he is a traitor and the fact he might become speaker of the house and be in like to be president is absolutely disgusting
16 years in congress and never managed to get a single bill passed what could go wrong with putting this dude in charge of the entire legislative process
we live in the worst timeline so i predict gym jordan will become speaker its also the stupidest timeline so it will take three votes
elise stefanik would be giving this exact same speech if she was nominating sauron or palpatine to be speaker
i have the pride the privilege nay the pleasure of introducing to you to a knight sired by knights a knight who can trace his lineage back beyond charlemagne i first met him atop a mountain near jerusalem praying to god asking his forgiveness for the saracen blood spilt by his sword next he amazed me still further in italy when he saved a fatherless beauty from the wouldbe ravishing of her dreadful turkish uncle in greece he spent a year in silence just to better understand the sound of a whisper and so without further gilding the lily and with no more ado i give to you the seeker of serenity the protector of italian virginity the enforcer of our lord god the one the only hakeeeeeem jeffrieeees

hahaha santos buckled after talking all that smack and voted for a gym membership
fox news switched back to tank footage in israel
man if only jeffries could get 6 more votes
it would only take six people to make this the funniest speaker election in 247 years
why did democrats do this to jim jordan  they should respect the institution

s for anyone who needs it
i dont think anyone in history has gotten more votes for speaker than hakeem jeffries
listening to the cspan callers republican voters really are just the least politically informed voting block
knowing that jordan is currently down more than mccarthy was at any point during the 15 votes it took for him to eventually secure the seat makes me so fucking happy
again these duplicitous shameless republicans are blaming the democrats for not  voting for gym jordan wtf

how about 6 of those republicans who voted against jordan help the democrats for a change and switch their votes to jeffries that way at least the nation will have a speaker who isnt a maga insurrectionist and election denier

it is not the democrats responsibility to save republicans from themselves from their own fascist bullshit thats their job  they should quit being so lazy
on jordan gimenez said his tactics certainly didnt work on me actually i became more cemented in my position

you dont push people into leadership that i have to follow you ill follow you if youre a leader he added
its absolutely wild that these people have convinced people i know that democrats are the problem here
in other insurrectionist newsbullhorn lady just received 57 months in federal prison
jordan needs a lot of help to win      
i wonder if boebert has offered to lend a hand 
i dont think democrats call cspan democratic phone line
stefanik just has that look that shes an allaround terrible humanbeing  probably why shes climbed the gop leadership latter so quickly i guess
jordan holdouts face meat grinder of pressurehttpsapnewscomhousespeakervoteliveupdates0000018b3ee4d98aa18bfefe0b510000

rep thomas massie a kentucky republican and jordan ally who has resisted party leadership in the past said the holdouts on the house speaker vote would now be put through a meat grinder of pressure

beatings will continue until conformity is achieved
context for anyone who doesnt know  the rny rep who voted for lee zeldin is anthony desposito he is the rep for the district directly south of george santos and has been one of the ny republicans calling for santos to resign 

him not voting for jordan is to show his traditionally blue district that he isnt falling in line with the farright which is especially important because ny had to do some redistricting after our awful gerrymandering attempt in 2022 and despositos district is likely to go back to being blue unless he does something to convince them otherwise this is combined with the fact that the anger over santos in the district next door which was formerly a d2 district itself has spilled over to despositos as well which may result in him becoming a casualty of santoss bullshit just by association

edit wrote 2020 but meant 2022
jesus christ the cspan callers are crazy
the silent but actually loud majority fails to get any sort of majority ever go figure
deleted
hahaha this is such sweet sweet joy the pic with mccarthy laughing his ass off behind a worried looking gym is pure gold they cant even get their own house in order let alone the peoples house i hope everyone does their part to vote out these damn losers from the majority
man i want george santos to vote for himself just to hear everyone break out in laughter when the temp speaker has to announce the honorable george santos gets one vote
deleted
i choose to believe c span is trolling everyone by rerunning the first vote
fox news is floating the idea of them choosing a speaker based on a plurality

httpswwwfoxnewscompoliticsjordancouldbecomespeakerwithouthousemajorityriskygambitlastusedbeforecivilwarhttpswwwfoxnewscompoliticsjordancouldbecomespeakerwithouthousemajorityriskygambitlastusedbeforecivilwar

this is way risky for jordan isnt it  even fox news admits at the very bottom

any miscalculation on votes in a plurality election would run the risk of the gop inadvertently handing the speakership to the democrats should gop members break from the party  
however should the gop need a nuclear option to choose a new speaker historical precedent provides one

x200b

like this is a nonstarter for the republicans right
so hes not a pedophile but he enabled a pedophile

repubs   have you seen the other guys we elected speaker
rep mario diazbalart of florida sent a letter to interim speaker patrick mchenry calling for the house to reconvene immediately and start voting on the second ballot
gop doorkeeper apparently decided to force female reporters to leave the speakers lobby based on the shoes they were wearing

good to know these clowns still know how to enact rules when it means being assholes to women
can you guys believe trump supported a loser what does that say about him
several of the jordan holdouts  including reps mario diazbalart kay granger steve womack mike simpson carlos gimenez and mariannette millermeeks  called for mchenry to start another round of votes

either they want to embarrass jordan some more or they changed their votes  perhaps they are betting jordan will have less support after the first round
remember folks its about the journey not the destination
republicans say there wont be another vote today
if we only have one vote a day then this will take 3 weeks to match the 15 votes for mccarthy
that makes 15 failed attempts to elect a speaker

the 118th session has been without a speaker for a total of 19 days

compared to the democrats 116th and 117th sessions who had zero failed votes for speaker and managed to have a speaker the entire time
jim jordan has proven what i once though unprovable  someone is even weaker and lacking in fortitude and conviction then kevin mccarthy

mccarthy actually had enough gumption to sit through multiple votes in one day

gymmy just took his ball and ran home

what a weenie
so jordan cant get the votes together its almost like its harder to actually do something then it is to sit in a corner and scream all day like a toddler
mccarthy blaming the democrats lmao

why do the democrats keep letting us shit our pants
find it offensive that the house coming to order is preceded with prayer i mean wtf this is the beginning of a congressional session not bible study hour

keep separation of church and state truly separate as this aint it imo
for those of you saying that the dems caused this to happen what the fuck did you want them to do keep mccarthy in after he broke his promises to the left thats the only other option since they dont have the majority keeping mccarthy as speaker would absolutely have made the democrats look weak and corrupt yes gym jordan is worse but theres not much you can do when the right get caught with their pants wet and then instead of going to change they shit themselves in anger
mccarthy said he blamed every single democrat who voted to stop one branch of government lmfao yeah dude blame the democrats for thinking you shouldnt be speaker you couldnt convince your entire party that you were good enough and its somehow the democrats fault
it speaks volumes that the gop would cast aside its highestranking member and most prolific fundraiser in exchange for an insurrectionist who voted to overthrow the 2020 presidential election  a guy who is in his 9th term in congress but has never passed a single piece of legislation imagine going to congress nine different times and not accomplishing a single thing aside from going on tv and acting like a clown 

and look at his priorities when he did try to introduce legislation national restrictions on abortion ending gay marriage a 0 tax rate for the rich
mccarthy the ultimate fucking beta lmao
guessing he wasnt able to get the votes today and pushed it until tomorrow at 11 am must be nice to be in a job where you have multiple weeks off and only have to work one hour a day
i think the sad thing about jordan if he becomes speaker will be that hes literally done nothing but lob bombs at legislationinvestigations and be a regular on conservative media shows a bunch of lawmakers have personal pet projects be it creating new legislation or doing the best to try to regulatesimplify systems jordan throughout his time in congress has had none of that hes barely helped pass anything because he seemingly just likes to stir shit up

if trump was the president made by fox news you can damn well bet jordan will be the speaker made by them as well
once again the republican party takes 1000 steps to the right

and once again they will ask dems to meet in the middle


the moderate republicans are now to the right of the most extreme right wings from a few decades ago
mentioning gyms wrestling history as a plus is certainly a choice
im glad they mentioned the fact hes passed nothing in a decade and a half
mccarthy with his 1 vote is about to get his jeb bush moment
democratic rep gerry connolly shouts no to insurrectionists before voting for hakeem jeffries for speaker
my applause  meter said jeffries won that clap off
i mean will jordan even crack 200 votes at this rate lol
why so much noise with lees vote
jordan lost the clown show continues also as an ohioan fuck that guy
peltola was applauded as its her first vote returning to congress after her husband died in a place crash
whoop whoop thats the sound of the scalise

i cant believe jordan is so bad im cheering when rs vote scalise
awww yea 15  lets get to 20  fuck you gymothy
the gop giving a standing ovation to scalise solely for being magnanimous enough to vote for jordan tells you everything you need to know about the average house republican mentality
i love when talking heads go im curious what republican strategy will be for next round like they fucking had one to begin with lmao
do we really want to put a fucking election denier and trump loyalist second in line to the presidency
democrats should start nominating the wrestling coaches from other big ten schools just to fuck with gym
republicans had almost two whole weeks to figure this out and failed
that vote should put to rest the notion that there are only a handful of radical republicans

good times  jake tapper

lmfao
lmfao this woman crying on cspan cause people didnt vote for jordan
lmfao at that lady who called into cspan crying 

get bent lady
im politically homeless crazy lady from texas
lady from austinno one is buying that you are actually a democrat
damn it hunter biden how dare you cause this
gym is a winner  
  
immediately loses   the republican party everyone
even if the democrats had voted for someone else jordan wouldnt have won how is this on them
has jordan told the holdouts he will let them get away with raping minors seems like that would get them on his side
i think people have to realize that this is actually what a lot of the republicans want to be happening some of them are being funded by groups including russia to make the us government look weak unorganized and pathetic gaetz didnt lead the charge against mccarthy because of some ideological battle it was done precisely to cause chaos like this if they get an extremist nutjob like jordan out if it great but thats besides the point now the point is to destroy america democracy and world stability
based pelosi quote httpstwittercomnicholaswu12status1714342447856164937
just to synthesize whats been said elsewhere they probably thought that there would only be a handful of no votes who could then be bullied into submission by conservative media and whatnot now that the number of no votes is larger than expected they have no idea how to respond
you folks realize that weeping old lady from texas was actually sean hannity right
he is even farther behind then mccarthy on his first vote that is not a good sign do you think he will break mccarthys record
jordan is going to push for a second vote manu raju reporting many who voted against him wont change
gop rep carlos gimenez who voted for rep kevin mccarthy as speaker during the last vote said he would never vote for rep jim jordan but would consider voting for other candidates
mccarthy still out there blaming the democrats for his complete failure of leadership
deleted
why cant we just have a coalition government like other western democracy does
if those 20 republicans were actually serious about getting back to work they would have voted for jeffries

edit fixed incorrect word from autocorrect
seething like hector salamancahttpsiimgurcomjrhqfrjjpeg
why dont they elect a moderate as a placeholder speaker at least 

it blows my mind that moderate republicans are more willing to deal with 20 extremists than 200 democrats no attempt at joint governance on their part

and that point is never brought up once on npr
republicans that want to get democratic support for a moderate republican would need to convince the democratic caucus and jeffries that they will receive sufficient and reliable benefits to that approach over the benefits of the disaster wing of the republican party continuing to embarrass their party the democratic representatives have no obligation to save the gop majority from itself
well how many rounds do we predict this time
what an incredible speech with the dems behind him emphasizing he said no
truly disgusting to see this mess juxtaposed with the news coming out of gaza were paralyzed with inaction because a small majority of our representatives are morons
their is only one person that could be speaker and the name is jeb
why would the democrats do this s
i know theyre using dirty tactics overtly on social media

how hard do you think jordan is going behind closed doors

some thats a nice family you have sure be a shame if something happens to them to the holdouts
imma need about tree fiddy
 rep r lochness monster

on how gym jordan would get their vote
the 20 anti jordan should hold their ground or else the 8 original anti mccarthy zealots will own the republican caucus
over at r  conservative theyd rather complain about the squad
with no respect chip roy gym jordan absolutely does not fucking speak for me and i am part of the american people  get fucked with this bullshit
they will never hand jeffries the gavel  i think they eventually go back to mccarthy or scalise after another few humiliations  it could be worse honestly  they area ll scum of the earth but hopefully we wind up with a nonfanaticalmaga
im sorta surprised stefanik hasnt been nominated she really seems to suck seems perfect for theme
id love it if one of the holdouts when asked for his vote goes elmo from sesame street  hes better than the rest of these muppets

x200b

except im thinking sesame street is too woke now for them  they have diverse characters   
 too woke
who could have imagined that coalescing around a weird little unlikable gremlin would be so difficult
still too many votes for jordan
imagine if there was a rule that if a speaker could not be voted in by majority the next vote would be winner by plurality then either jeffries would win based on the last vote or it would at least force republicans to cooperate and vote someone in
how many votes do you guys think it will be before mtg nominates trump
jordan might have another vote tonight but i wager he is banking on the late night talk shows on fox to do the bullying for him
gym probably couldnt get a single person to change their vote after hours of trying hence moving to tomorrow weak
its just wild to have an insurrectionist thats what 2nd in line to the presidency fucking wild he has no purpose being the speaker

edit fixed succession 
interesting timing republican debbie lesko just announced she is not running for reelection
the guy that just got 200 votes was against benefits for 911 victim families think about that never stop saying it either all should voted for him knows this and they still voted for him
just a reminder that jordan is one more step towards the heritage foundation 2025 plan

sounds like he could start bleeding support if he doesnt wrap this up sooner rather than later
so republicans had about a week and a half and this is the best they could do hahaha
lol this is so embarrassing for republicans fox news pivots to israel coverage
humiliatingly jordan has less support than mccarthy did on the first vote 203 votes mccarthy 19 others  vs  200 votes jordan 20 votes other
20  yikes i was assuming much closer to 67 on the first vote

please dont fold like lawn chairs gop holdouts your former speaker called jordan a legislative terrorist do better
notice that theyre not just voting present which would reduce the burden of majority they are actively voting other people aka no which means that they dont want him and they dont want jeffries if they wanted to end this farce right now we just need like 7 or 8 gop to vote present and jeffries would take it

cspan caller lifelong democrat that says anything that democrats touch turns bad ffs these people just spilling lies
why would hunter bidens penis do this
nominate hunter bidens dick since all the gop love to follow that around
for the gop to nominate and confirm one of their own who in his 20 years in congress has never passed a law recently proposed legislation for a national abortion ban and has consistently exhibited a total disregard for rules and norms as well as failed to report the sexual abuse of dozens of students under his care this man is an extremist and he is being put in power by cowards who consider themselves to be moderates but are in fact just extremist cowards
he said no 

so say we all
an insurrectionist is about to be 3rd in line because any moderate gop person is too much of a pussy to do what right for the country and not for themselves of course if they ever cared about shit beyond themselves they wouldnt be gop in the first place
if jordan wins this hes the most shameful leader of the house since dennis hastert
i want to see an r drop a jeffries vote for pure chaos
now any three republicans have the chance to do the funniest thing of all time
up to 7 already him calling this vote knowing he wont get the votes is exactly why he shouldnt be anywhere near being speaker

he shouldnt even be in congress
jordans strategy for this appears to have been put it to a vote theyll definitely fold

which may not have been entirely wrong but theres a reason pelosi got the speakership she knew how to count
closing in on wont break 200 territory which i dont think mccarthy ever actually fell below
lol mccarthy
mccarthy has a humiliation fetish

theres really no other reasoning around it
matt gaetz lauren boebert and george santos all sitting next to each other  what a pathetic trio
damn right traitors should not be rewarded with power

sobbing that the 20 republicans have committed treason against the country
wow one based cspan caller calling out the bible quoting woman love it
mom says its my turn to be nominated for speaker
i dont have much faith in the sanity of republicans they keep trying to negotiate with their own crazy nutjobs but not with any democrats so now the nutjobs know they hold all the power as long as gop moderates wont work with democrats

its like being in a game of chicken with someone who is prepared to kill themselves to win
lady who doesnt understand that the spending is eliminating one of the largest threats according to even old republicans to our nation eliminating the need to actively fund force readiness to counter it
republicans cannot govern
i wish i didnt live in this country so i could laugh at this whole circus a little bit more than i currently am
wasnt the plan to keep calling vote after vote back to back guess gym is not doing as well as they planned
damn i was hoping for some primetime fuckery
gym jordan is not fit to serve my gut says that he will ultimately get the support of the republican caucus i hope im wrong republicans collectively are incapable of governing and in many cases actively work against the interests of americans the work they do accomplish benefits those who wish to sow discord and further the deepening divisions of americans
i am still in disbelief that republicans in biden districts are going to vote for him a man who sponsored a national abortion ban and who wants to end same sex marriage

even if ethical reservations about jordan didnt convince them to vote no it seems like their instincts for self preservation would
if only republicans didnt hate science we could learn so much if they donated their bodies to science after they pass like how do they stand up despite not having a spine

just laughing at tom kean today

hid in his basement for the past week finally announced he was supporting jordan today despite representing a district that biden won and jim jordan trying to disenfranchise keans own voters by overturning the election and jordan lost the vote
honestly i was sure jordan was doomed from the start then i came into this doom and gloom thread 45 minutes ago  and the prevailing sentiment was jordan was going to squeak it out 

and now as i type this i see 11 others on cspan and theyre not even through the farking ks yet

jefferies cracking the 200 mark 16 votes over jordan
other than just obviously cowardice i dont understand why the nynj republicans dont unite as a bloc and say that theyll trade their votes to jordan or whoever in exchange for repealing the salt deduction cap

even if they were going to vote for jordan anyways at least itd look to their constituents back home like they were getting something out of voting for a pedophile
jordan 200

jeffries 212

others 20
do not normalize having an insurrectionist for speaker 
i know it is a non starter for most people but for one would love to see jefferies and other dem leaders approaching the 20 others to see what they can negotiate for their support  may turn to nothing maybe if lucky turn 1 or 2  but at least be seen trying to bridge the gap and get congress functioning again  show the leadership in action
foxs brian kilmeade caught on a hot mic calling rep don bacon a dumbass for voting mccarthy

httpstwittercomnikkimcrstatus1714326082986406262t6qg4sukegjzchz536ppzrws19
its funny to think that with just 5 more seats in the house dems would have the majority and wed have avoided 2 full years of bullshit i cant believe theres still americans out there voting for the gop i hope the comeuppance they deserves comes fiercely in 2024
the republican caucus in the house is broken 

youve got 1020 sane republicans who recognize the danger maga represents and are hoping they can save the party 

youve got 1020 magas who will accept nothing short of full control and a fascist takeover of the federal government 

the rest are all spineless goobers who will go along to get along 

mccarthy was able to win by making promises to both sides knowing they were mutually exclusive hoping no one would dare oppose him once he had the gavel no one is falling for that gambit again 

there will be no consensus candidate among republicans only dems need to hold out and extract maximum concessions before agreeing to any republican candidate 

it will be a real test for jeffries keeping all dems in line as the pain of this dysfunctional house rachets up
 ultimately reps don bacon of nebraska carlos gimenez of florida mario diazbalart of florida john rutherford of florida mike simpson of idaho tony gonzales of texas nick lalota of new york mike lawler of new york john james of michigan victoria spartz of indiana lori chavezderemer of oregon jake ellzey of texas anthony desposito of new york andrew garbarino of new york ken buck of colorado mike kelly of pennsylvania and jen kiggans of virginia opposed him opposed his nomination 

thank you

please dont give into the pressure or death threats

keep voting no on jordan
when scalise was the nominee for 5 minutes i thought it meant the white supremacist coalition was stronger than the pedo enabler caucus but 200 votes for gym jordan tells me the pedo enabler caucus is pretty substantial in the gop
wait lady on cspan says hamas was able to attack because of infighting in american politics lol man
good old john kasich trying to put partial blame on democrats for this chaos
installing an extremist bomb thrower like jordan as speaker of the house could be the final nail in our countrys coffin
maybe if we do it again the result will be different next time  the gop probably
the republican holdouts should threaten to vote for jeffries if jordan doesnt withdraw they could actually force the rest of their conference to vote for someone at least minimally acceptable
republicans just vote present
someone needs to nominate a head of lettuce  it seems to be having a pretty strong winning streak lately
i volunteer to nominate myself as speaker of the house i will never show up to dc because i dont wanna however i did not try to overthrow our democracy
whos next if jordan fails stefanik donalds clint eastwood
target is 6 eastern so expect voting to begin closer to 630 or 7
when this happens in the uk dont they do a new election we should have that here
just saw a post from scott wong saying jordan said voting is over for today with the next round scheduled for 11 am tomorrow
its joever for the day
what a cuck mccarthy is
cnn reporting theres actually a real consensus pick emerginghttpsiimgurcombdpmi2kjpeg someone who just might be able to win over all the democrats and the jordan supporters
deleted
hes going to win

this ensures a shutdown because jordan works for trump and trump wants a shutdown

anything that will trash the economy before the 2024 election
will he actually wear a jacket now
sadly for america  i dont have high confidence that were not going to come out of this day with jim jordan as speaker  

if thats the case  expect more government shutdowns more partisan gridlock and more grandstanding
catholics  biden is going after catholics
joe pesci in an outdated second hand tuxedo everything that guy just said was bullshit thank you
lost the first round lmao
lost 4 votes already god damn speed run fail
lol jordan lost already
its more fun having jeffries and jordan so close together in the alphabet you can really see how the two applauses compare
this is really bad for jodran if he missed by 56 votes you could flip them but if he cant get to 200 he might lose even more next round
mccarthy you doink
kevin you spineless turd
imagine hearing other members vote for you and you vote against yourself lmaooo
a coup plotter and ongoing insurrectionist getting any votes for speaker is alarming
glad some republicans were able to set aside partisanship to show support for peltola and her grieving
this is the most embarrassing performance by a jordan since michael went to play baseball in 1994
just want to point out that a ton of the jordan no votes are not even from moderates but regular establishment no names this is a bigger deal imo bc it shows some weakness from jordan that isnt related to his ideology
nothing is more perfectly descriptive of modern republicans than them jerking themselves off every time jordans name gets called despite him losing the vote already they totally fail at the basic levels of governance but go wild at the stupidest pretenses to pretend theyre not fuck ups
this lack of republican leadership makes you appreciate that when pelosi was speaker she was able to get everyone on board and get her elected despite differences
the 5 non votes so far could be straight ballers and vote present to give it to jeffries at this point haha
table in the post above has been updated  give it up for round 1 everybody

 i just called bacon and told his staff that i appreciated his vote and encouraged him to stand strong if anyone has time consider contacting one of the 20 holdouts and doing the same
maybe the supposed 5 hard no votes for jordan in the gop should start a countdown vote  each round one more agrees to vote for jeffries

see jordans pressure campaign and raise them a pressure campaign

or they could just show mccarthyesque spinelessness  backpeddle and vote for an insurrectionist that even today would not say trump wonlost because hes such a massive pos
did stefanik seriously mention gym jordan on the wrestling mat holy shit she is wildly dumb
fox news is told that some dissenters are only willing to give jordan a ballot or two with some noting that house majority leader steve scalise was never given a chance for a vote on the floor of the house

getting sick and tired of this movie turning it off

second vote is expected today apparently per cnn
yet another day of not passing republican legislation praise be
kept an eye on the five idiots on fox news just to see what their stupid take was on todays vote

took them 50 minutes to mention it and all they did was blame the democrats for not giving votes to jordanseems like they arent really ready to comment until hannity talks about it later
lol i heard jordan was planning to keep voting today until a speaker was elected they went to recess right after the first vote
i hate this process there should be one vote and winner becomes speaker cant figure it out when your own party has the majority tough luck
jims getting it daddy donald demanded it and for as much as these losers stomp and whine they all fall in line at the end of the day
love mccarthy standing there applauding the guy taking his job what a colossal tool
did she really mention him wrestling probably not the best talk track on gym
the absolute gall of elise stefanik to mention jim jordan and wrestling in the same sentence  what a vile woman lying through her teeth on behalf of an even more vile man
its so hard watching these traitors openly lie and try to gaslight for their entire speeches stfu with these bible quotes separation of church and state traitors
the he said no is pretty powerful ngl
these fucking idiot republicans are really going to give this asshole jim jordan the speakership terrible day
ok jefferies is winning stop the voting
no other nomination jordan has the votes its over my ass
please please let jeffries finish with more votes than jordan  i wont be able to stand the hilarity
btw some of these gop members voting against jordan are in trumpwon districts this is not just the biden moderates
pelosi is just sitting there laughing her ass off lol
applause for a man who has already lost

lol lmao even
how many more republicans need to no show until the have accidentally allowed jeffries to be elected
deleted
wow his fellow ohio rep refusing to vote when calledrough
the legend of zeldin
this many holdouts has to be a bit of a shock sounded like it was going to be closer than this
even if people vote present jordan is doing far worse than expected
there are just zero gop candidates for speaker that will appease both the freedom caucus crazies who started this mess and the swingdistrict members who are biting their nails over 2024 absolutely zero
did mccarthy just vote for jordan tf
mccucky votes against himself
mccarthy is the biggest pussy lmao all thise closed door meeting were just the freedumb caucas trying to blackmail people and we all know mccarthy is spineless so he goes along with it
msnbc counts as of miller of wv

jeffries 126
jordan 130
mccarthy 5
scalise 4
other 4
its amazing that these jackoffs all made more money today by saying someones name and clapping stupidly than i will make in my entire 2 weeks paycheck while doing actual work
take a shot every time someone in this thread asks if an r voted for jeffries
fox just dipped to the israel situation
santos only voted once he has like 5 aliases should get 5 votes s
well guess im not going to get any work done today as i sit and watch this catastrophic shit show
ok all the smiths should only get one vote to save time
50 years from now historians will piece together maternal alcohol consumption and leaded gas to the generation that produces these brainaddled narcissistic sociopathic republicans who only vote to preserve their own status
its absurd how long the voting process takes
jefferies has the most haha
heh in all 15 rounds mccarthy at least stayed above the 200 mark

good job gym
the thing is that the entire campaign jordan has run at this point is blitzkrieg shockandawetalk the no votes around before they can think better of it and so forth rush the vote and maybe you get the people to act thoughtlessly

if you cant pull it off in the blitz its going to be trickier once you get bogged down
that gavel bang was pedestrian  i expect nay demand bigger and better  a precedent was set 2 weeks ago that was half assed and the country knows it
stefanik has such crazy handmaids tale vibes
cspan crazy call ins never disappoint this woman is in tears at the 20 gopers

i still think jordan drops out this circus is the easiest and most effective way to shut down the government that is all maga faction wants to do
jordan lost a lot more representatives than was expected he needs 217 votes so he can only afford to lose three people there were maybe 56 who were strongly against him and im sure jordan has been pressuring them there were another 56 on the fence having 20 republican representatives vote for someone else is a very high hill to climb even if some of those 20 were protesting how mccarthy was removed and plan to vote for jordan next round its unlikely hell reach the magic 217
idk how the republican party survives this they are clearly being held hostage by the farright wing of their party and for what jordan being speaker changes nothing the democrats control the senate and executiveall this infighting is for nothing the only thing it accomplishes is proving the republican party is on its way to imploding or forever being a husk of its former self
i say if after 5 failed votes we go straight to a battle royale
this is like a sequel to the movie we all loved to hate but its basically the same movie with worse actors
too bad its not the highest amount of votes

republicans should  cut a deal with the dems to govern otherwise maga wins
virtually every trump clone does not play well with a national audience trump has some teflon umbrella where so much horrible shit just rolls off never touching him every trump endorsed facsimile very much lacks that

people really do not want jordan and the crazies cant see it

rep jim jordans spokesman said to expect another vote on electing a speaker on tuesday the house needs a speaker as soon as possible expect another round of votes today its time for republicans to come together russell dye saidhttpswwwwashingtonpostcompolitics20231017housespeakervotelink3fd3zcdyvfcghpo2ug5uszz5ui
we have month left until government run out of money
jim jordans interest when it comes to whipping is in the context of slavery
postponed until tomorrow what a clown show
republican ballot

jim jordan                   

ronald mcdonald     

kevin mccarthy         

micky mouse         x 
the problem is that gym is such an asshole that most of his own party cant stand him and hes had run ins with everyone lol i imagine theres a more a couple who are just telling him to get fucked whenever he calls asking for their vote
fuck again with the prayer

yall your sky daddy has no place in government leave the prayer out of it
so is it jordan without a doubt  no way the republicans or at least the temp speaker are dumb enough to actually schedule and hold a vote that could result in anything else  they would be laughed out the room  oh wait
me during the summer seeing mtg act as temporary speaker of the house is the most physically disgusting thing ive seen all year 

2023 youve seen nothing yet
i know this is just the quorum vote but we really need all 212 dems to be there voting
republicans pelosi is the devil who cant govern and unfit to be speaker



also republicans votes for a speaker then oust said speaker after he prevented a government shutdown



also also republicans votes for speaker a guy who hasnt written any major legislation despite being in congress for nearly two decades
jim jordan is an insurrectionist electiondenier who has no place being second in line to the presidency
the person nominating gym jordan just mentioned that hes a fighter on the wrestling mat which audibly caused some commotion in the house chamber
no she didnt  wrestling mat
what a disaster for america

listening to elise stefanik makes me want to vomit

how anyone can believe gop trump rhetoric is beyond me
she actually brought up wrestling lol
come on aguilar bring up gyms actions at ohio state go for the throat
when wrestlers were being raped he said nothing
epistrophehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiepistrophe is the term for this powerful repetition of he said no
when his student athletes asked for an investigation into sexual abuse at the ohio state universityhe said nothing
well happy shutdown everybody

lets drink
kevin mccarthy was a spineless coward who gave the maga fascists any and everything they wanted just so he could have the title of speaker

what the hell could jim jordan offer to moderate republicans who have refused to support him for the job
435 districts 435 house members and they pick jordan of the depressed rust belt district i grew up in 

it isnt personal but it feels more personal than it should since i have almost nothing positive to say about living in that part of ohio plus i can easily believe that most people there either cant name their rep or dont care about the whole coach sex abuse scandal a decent amount likely outright support some of his statements about trump and january 6th

and politicians like this only allow environments like that to fester further
spineless coward
mccarthy just loves emasculating himself on live television
i hope they vote again immediately and he loses more votes  thatd be fucking epic  shit i think im gonna go make some pop corn  dunno wtf im doing without any at this point
mccarthys spine is so rubbery i could use it as a spare tire
212212 for jeffries

no surprise there
remember to stretch after your 4th bowl of popcorn
there he sits broken hearted

jordan ran but his party sharted
they took a week off for absolutely nothing
apparently this was not expected in the jordan camp didnt expect 20 nos
still dont understand how so many penn state officials got taken down in their scandal and jordan right near the center of the ohio state scandal just skated on by
sean hannity and producers getting their burn book ready for fox news prime time 

ken buck is the nastiest skank bitch do not trust him he is a fugly slut
will we see mike rogers lunge again on the house floor
logically jordan should get fewer votes in round 2 but then again were talking about republicans here
omg the reasoning ken buck voted for tom emmer was insane

i voted for him because i dont like him
its hard to hear someone say the honorable jim jordan or kevin mccarthy and not vomit a little in my mouth 
these callers are awesome this woman is crying lol
dont forget 

will guarantee a government shutdown in novemeber
some idiots see that as a good thing
maybe this is because i didnt listen in civics too good but isnt basically 17 years of inaction not doing your job at all and shouldnt he have been replaced by now 

i mean imagine skating through your office job for just a couple monthsyoud be on a final written warning before being shitcanned
shes 85 and in a safe district she dont give any fucks its amazing
mock fascists directly in their faces this is the way
obviously he believes trump won since he was involved in jan 6
jeffries won the plurality of the vote which has been used to decide speakership in the past by 12 votes 12 house reps represent about the amount of people that live in new jersey
if the 5 hard nos stick to their guns that should be enough to sink jordan
the dam broke  the wait and see people saw and are not voting for him now  typical spinelessness
normally these things are snoozefests but if it means more humiliation for jordan im locked
deleted
not that it makes it any better but hes also running unopposed by another republican now where he wasnt then just worth noting that a lot of this is spineless republicans just refusing to work to find a better option than jordan
wait theres a second pence
kind of disqualifying for a prospective house speaker  you know fucking your first attempt at anything to death
not surprising from someone who has never passed a bill
there will be a new session before that happens
math is woke
nancy pelosi for all her faults does dole out some sick burns ive read through her congressional blognews every now and then and shes got some scorchers
man im chugging hopium this man is a deplorable scourge
if he gets 13 more yeses and 7 presents he wins otherwise he needs 17 more yeses

if theres 9 presents then jeffries wins
i wouldnt be surprised if these clowns couldnt do the math
after 18 gaetz gives up usually way earlier than that
high school halloween party season is startaing
theres way too many people who are privileged enough to not give a single fuck about politics
this isnt your dads gop anymore it is full bore maga at this point
i can the last president was an actual traitor
cspan republican caller we have too many regulations

cspan republican caller why cant they fix my drinking water

its a rental

well not this coup he clarified
whats on todays hot docket mr speaker
jim jeffries is the obvious compromise here
deleted
im not sure if its worth the long term damage a speaker jordan could do in a short amount of time
i dont think it guarantees hes done but its definitely not a good sign for jim
they always remind me how nuts people really are  

so when people ask how did trump get voted in cspan callers are exactly why  a lot of people are uneducated nutters in this country
i think its by design that he needs 17 votes and we need to take our country back

what the fuck lady lmao
thats totally crazy for the republicans   hasnt jefferies had a plurality in every vote except for the one that elected mccarthy
hes done this was a major embarrassment they had one play and it was to force the vote and expect members to fall in line now they have no strategy and no idea where to go from here theyve tried bullying and are all out of ideas
those democrats keep shitting in my pants
democrats should compromise with reps by letting the repsdo literally whatever they want with no questions

duh
because that would require working together and republicans refuse to do that
1 for every year jorden has passed no bills 16 rounds
1 more today then a break for recalculations and negotiations
hope they dont end up on a wrestling mat anytime soon
i mean they hate women over there so it makes sense
correct they have failed to elect a new shit
if jordan wins speakership there will be a shutdown anyway 
my family is mexican sure
20 was a lot more than his team expected im assuming hes challenging the holdouts to a wrestling match
santos is the only logical gop unity candidate
please clap
it was a newborn john conner and santos has to protect him from the terminators
its going to be elected speaker tomorrow
republicans are actively trying to dismantle government they say this all the time its no secret
those same idiots complaining about government spending who also dont have a problem with jim jordans accumulated salary over 16 years of 278400000 not including healthcare costs all the insider trading you can eat etc  and in return for this the republican voter getsnothing
goddamn that is too old

and if she hasnt groomed a successor then shame on her
no he believes saying trump won will benefit him and the people he thinks need to be benefited and harm the people he thinks need to be harmed
lets hope so but i dont trust moderate republicans to hold out  a jordan supporter came out yesterday and said jordan will be elected speaker tomorrow or the moderates will finally grow a spine  which one do you think is more likely
a second pence has hit the congress
i wouldnt put it past house republicans to screw up the math and accidentally elect jeffries by having too many present votes
lmao i refuse to believe you and op didnt set this up
why he even brings the thunder
hilarious after the clusterfuck they were responsible for on the previous votes they thought rs would fall in line behind gym   these people are fucking idiots
16 rounds and whaddya get

another day older and a gym jordan threat

mr speaker dont call me cause i cant go

i sold my soul to the insurrection bros
if a republican cant denounce the rapes and sexual assaults of wrestlers then theyre not moderate"
discussion thread second house speaker election of 2023,"earlier this month on october 3rd representative kevin mccarthys term as speaker of the us house of representatives came to a close after his fellow republican matt gaetz successfully moved to vacate the chair  gaetzs ability to do this was the result of the agreement from januaryhttpswwwnbcnewscompoliticscongressspeakerofthehouseoustedmotiontovacatercna64902 struck between a faction within the farright house freedom caucus of which gaetz is a member and mccarthys much more numerous supporters in the house republican caucus

earlier today in a closedtothepublic meeting the house republican caucus voted via secret ballot 113 to 99 to nominate steve scalise over jim jordan to be the next speaker  this afternoon the full house is expected to have another vote or votes to chose the speaker without whom the house can conduct essentially no business  some republican representatives are indicating that they will not back scalise for speaker despite his informal nomination within the caucus what happens next remains to be seen  the house democratic caucus is expected to remain consolidated behind house minority leader hakeem jeffries

in the very short time since this discussion thread was posted todays vote for the house speaker has apparently been postponed without being immediately rescheduled  per the new york times live threadhttpswwwnytimescomlive20231011ushousespeakervotenews745258fda9a5522c8e7cf89fe99e23e9

the move to recess comes as it became clear that scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the house floor today and members complaining of a rushed process

we are leaving this discussion thread up for the time being in case there are further developments today
so if i have this right
 republicans ousted their speaker in mccarthy without a backup plan
 they took a recess for a week just to continue to squabble over who is next and continued to get paid
 they still cannot figure their shit out with their nominated speaker barely getting by in a secret vote
 proceeded to take the rest of the day off because they didnt want to embarrass themselves on tv again 

all while the israel and hamas situation unfolds
and all the while the government shutdown looms and weve already lost some 8 days to prevent one because of the bs

do i have that right or did i miss something
good old steve im david duke without the baggage scalise

keep it up conservatives i bet your embarrassing losing streak is going to end any day now
it was 119  93 in a secret ballot neither were  close to getting the whole party behind them

whatever leadership r has for the vote basically went fuck it well do it live

let the shit show begin i wonder how the dems are going to get blamed this time
the move to recess comes as it became clear that scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the house floor today and members complaining of a rushed process

 well my days of not taking the gop seriously are certainly coming to a middle
 the move to recess comes as it became clear that scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the house floor today and members complaining of a rushed process

ok how much more proof do we need that the gop can not govern
one minor but important takeaway  trump endorsed jordan  he instructed the party to get behind jordan for speaker

in a secret ballot with no consequences more than half the gop said ha no

just in case trump ends up on the ballot and not in jail dems need to make sure they hammer home how weak a leader he is  even his own party ignores him
cnn is reporting that there will be no vote for house speaker today
wow how pathetic is this republican conference  one meeting and a secret vote and they call it a day without going to the floor to vote on a speaker  this is not what working for the people looks like at all  get your shit together
now the maga extremists are refusing to vote for scalise

david duke without the baggage just isnt conservative enough for republicans these days they want david duke with the baggage
how many votes will it take for david duke scalise to get it
rep troy nehlshttpswwwcspanorgvideo53105210reptroynehlsrepscalisewinningspeakernomination

 i have nothing against steve scalise i was just more on the jordan side im more of you know that freedom caucus guy and thats who donald trump wanted

 

 you got some people in the conference who obviously have some issues with donald trump but i would probably say to those in the republican conference that have problems with donald trump get over yourself cause donald trumps the leader of our party make no mistake 

 

 every decision we make as a conference should be in the best interest of getting donald trump the leader of our party who will be our nominee back in the white house in 2024 thats it that is my focus
sono vote today

clearly indicates that scalise doesnt have the 217 and the gop wants to avoid the same shenaniganshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjnpw2wz4d2s as last time

 what a fucking circus
republicans nominating a racist to represent the party sounds about right
the founders

should we put in some provision in case the house becomes so stalled and inept that a speaker cannot be elected thus grinding the government to a hault

nah too outlandish
its time for the next season of so you think you can speak

our contestants this season

 david duke without the baggage
 an ignorer ofdefender of sexual assault in college wrestling
 hakeem jeffries because this group is so fucking inept they might forget vote margins 

will someone physically assault matt gaetz will mgt introduce more revenge porn onto the floor how many votes will it take this time whats the difference between matt gaetz and a torpedo 

the tor part
this dude is not remotely qualified


us rep steve scalise who publicly questioned whether the democratic house leadership properly sought help during the jan 6 riot at the us capitol is now under fire after a videotape was released showing him at speaker nancy pelosis side as she telephoned for military assistance


house minority whip steve scalise rla reversed course tuesday and urged republicans to vote against a bill establishing a commission to investigate the jan 6 attack on the capitol
if lee corso doesnt come out on the house floor wearing the head of the next speaker what are we even doing here
enough is enough maybe we should try kevin mccarthy for speaker  the gop in a week
 the move to recess comes as it became clear that scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the house floor today and members complaining of a rushed process

hahahahahahaha
so is the white supremacist coalition stronger than the pedo coalition in the gop
im not sure whats going to happen but im feeling pretty good about george santoss chances of being the next speaker of the house
it is insane that the republican majority can just keep the house hostage without any voting happening
so they only have 1 order of business and they postponed it  is it just me or does anyone else think they cant do their job  which is right now literally only one thing
when steve scalise is the saner choice you know republicans are broken beyond repair
so they canceled it for today huh  

the level of dysfunction is astounding
well as of a little while ago the klan is in charge of the united states house of representatives they just made their bed
the party of dysfunctional government results in more governmental dysfunction who knew

i mean they shut down the government every time they control the house i guess this is pretty obvious at this point
i would bet money that mccarthy will be speaker again because they have no one else  its been a week and they have no one again  even their dysfunction is dysfunctional  of course its biden and the democrats fault somehow
trump taking another l today it seems  his boy gym conceded

deleted
timing update the house will not vote on electing a speaker this afternoon per source house will just come in at 3 and recess  so just a procedural vote

so scalise doesnt have the votes to take it on the floor and needs time to whip

key middle eastern ally is currently under attack and theyre out here playing political theater

this is a new low when it comes to gop incompetence and sheer selfishness
hey republicans here is a thought stop putting party extremism over country this is going to keep happening if you continue to put hard line extremist who only want to own the libs  forward
99 republicans thought jim jordan should be the next speaker

we are cooked as a country
the truly interesting thing here is whether the next speaker can beat mccarthys record 25 ballots
im sure this will be a calm and reasonable session of voting with constructive levelheaded discussions
oh i hope this works out another trump endorsement goes in the l column
so scalise gets the nod by a thin margin and jordan turns around and says ill support you if you can get to 217

there isnt enough popcorn in the world for this circus were watching
already at least three noes and a maybe

miller massie mtg maybe santos he wants protection from a motion to expel
remember when boehner was the worst 
the rush to the bottom is almost complete
ive a feeling they do get to scalise in 2 or 3 rounds at most out of the rs that have said no miller and giménez will end up voting for him mtg is a good chance to as well boebert is harder but can probably be whipped to vote present 


they just need a day to whip these nos that seem like easy flips so far
this chick is straight up evil

house speaker contender steve scalise reportedly called himself david duke without the baggage
why dont the more moderate less extreme republicans understand that they have just as much power as the freedom caucus republicans just threaten to work with democrats to select a compromise candidate if they dont get their act together or just do it find a super moderate oldschool republican that can work with democrats and avoid the shutdown and im sure you would get a majority with democrats

i guess they would all be primaried so they would have to care more about the country than about their jobs
not sure if this will be some 15 round clown show or fairly straightforward

initial comments suggest several of the 8 that voted to oust mccarthy will vote for scalise and several that voted for jordan for the nom will also back scalise

a few have said they wont vote for scaliseanyone but jordan and all they need is a few to tank the process well see i guess
there were a total of 212 votes in the conference this morning do we know who the missing votes were  and how did the nihilist wing of the gop vote
well at least it isnt jordan good sign for ukraine as well
oh were doing this again
does anyone know if they got rid of the 1 can start to vacate vote rule  hard to keep up with the train wreck that is the republican house ya know
scalise has the nomination now lets see if he gets the required votes i doubt it thats just me tho
i dont believe the republican party  remembers how to act as an intelligent cohesive political entity theyve been jimjordaned trumped and magaed to the nth degree they are utterly lost in there chaos of their own making when that tea party foolishness first came into being they shhave nipped it in the bud but greed racism and ambition allowed it to grow into the monster theyve got now its totally out of their hands  totally
damn jake tapper spitting fire i cant believe that marjorie taylor green wouldnt support him for this reason 
in response to nancy mace saying she wont vote for steve scalise because he  attending a white supremacist rally 

looks like the decision to fire chris licht was a good idea
theyre going to keep kicking the can to give pooty the best chance at destabilizing his opponents gaetz was ordered to cripple the us by either shutting down the entire government or the house either way we are essentially sidelined so he can shove thousands of rockets into desperate fanatical hamas hands get israel out of play internationally and stretch the us defense budget even thinner meanwhile election interference is given a continuing greenlight by useful idiot fox patrons and china uses mexican drug cartels to cripple liberal areas with fentanyl but the real threat is legal immigration of course because we certainly dont want to collect more taxes to fund national needs no no no we want tiny decentralized municipalities incapable of competing on a national scale its no surprise that most of genz is burying their head under cynicism and escapism theres barely anything rational or informed to cling to a fuckin kkk house speaker from a party that wants a civil war jesus fucking christ
this is gonna be big headlines in the morning

 whoa trump just attacked israel and said that hell never forget that they didnt participate in the soleimani operation he said israel let us down and needs to straighten it out and called them weak saying they should strengthen themselves up

httpswwwthreadsnettristansnellpostcyr_djxgjfigshidntc4mtiwnjq2yq

 trump just praised hezbollah as very smart for attacking israel

 yes you read that correctly

 breaking donald trump attacks israel says netanyahu let him down and hell never forget it and calls israel weak during a speech in west palm beach video and story
i know everyone here knows this but this is something that i plan on highlighting to everyone i know who still thinks that voting for republicans is in any way reasonable

the two people that vied quite closely to be the republican nominee as speaker are a man who ignored sexual abuse at his workplace and a guy who claimed to be david duke without the baggage of being known as a grand wizard that is who republicans are choosing between for leadership  ignoring pedophilia and sexual abuse or openly supporting white supremacy and they came down on the side of openly endorsing white supremacy
the gop couldnt lead outself out of a wet paper bag
so were done for the day

  vacatetion all i ever wanted
the move to recess comes as it became clear that scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the house floor today and members complaining of a rushed process

yo if anybody lives in a district with a vulnerable republican nows your chance to send them an emailhttpswwwhousegovrepresentativesfindyourrepresentative making a case for why they should make a compromise deal with the dems to elect jeffries in return for a powersharing agreement because at this point why the hell not
scalice got the nod i did nazi that coming

jordan and the treason caucus will sink him out of spite  the 3pm vote is gonna be a hoot
how many rounds are they gonna go through 

i need to know how long i need to edge for
i expect nothing and im still let down
how can anyone look at the modern state of the gop and think yeah im voting for these guys they are an utter disaster criticize the democrats all you want but at least the caucus is pretty united despite being a much more diverse in thought and ideology party
isnt scalise a climate change denier
im feeling like we aint going to have a new speaker anytime soon any off chance that some random republicans vote for the dem candidate just to end this farce and move on
oh thats one way of not showing your dysfunction on camera no vote today

boo we want ballots in the doubledigits
i got 99 problems but a speaker aint one  scalese probably
reading the cspan text looks like 113 for scalise 99 for jordan and 8 voted for other its going to be another shit show once they do start voting
bloomberg reporter on cspan just said when they do vote jim jordan has expressed hell nominate scalise on the floor himself and try to rally around him
republicans are divided on who should be the next speaker of the house the partys factionalism is evident and its unclear if they can unite before the floor vote
with jordan apparently throwing his support behind scalise i think the only question is how many of the nihilists will vote for scalise
removed
honestly i can see mccarthy still being the only one that can get close to 217 and will try to make a comeback days before the shutdown happens
and the shitshow continues
house recesses without voting on scalise as speaker
i really hate that nothing is treated as urgent mccarthy was voted out last week why are we waiting until wednesday of the next week to even have a vote
after 623 votes taking place across 44 days the republicans finally united to elect a speaker  just in time to put all the blame for the upcoming shutdown on him alone  
  
speaker buddy mcfluffyface had this to say woof  woof woof woof arooo  
  
translation  aint no rule that a dog cant play speakership

i keep singing this hamilton line in my head when jefferson is ragging on hamiltons central bank plan to madison saying sarcastically you dont have the votes you dont have the votes youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes
who would want this job
the blue check squad is revolting against gaetz for supporting scalise leopards are eating his face
arent speakers supposed to move legislation  this guy has never really passed anything other than performative bills never meant to become law because theyre just culture war set pieces  hes a party hack who hates gays and loves guns  hes no consensus builder  does the gop even remember what governing is
cowards needed to hold a behind closed doors vote using secret ballots 

the gop is an absolute mess
just pressed the popcorn button on the microwave
what did a few republicans threaten to vote for jeffries so they had to cancel the vote
call your representative let them know that this is embarrassing us on the world stage

theres chaos in europe and the middle east housing prices out of control childcare unattainable schools flailing

and we cant even rename a fucking post office right now because the gop ate its own tail
theyll meet at 12 pm today for anyone wondering


 the house adjourned pursuant to a previous special order the next meeting is scheduled for 1200 pm on october 12 2023


httpsclerkhousegovfloorsummary
regardless of which person is chosen lets all remember that this person will be second in line to the presidency therefore considering the gravity of this situation the eventual choice should inform everyone as to exactly what the gop has become and what they represent 

i mean if the majority choice for a role of this significance is a radical extremist or someone who has sympathies with radical extremists then the gop is simply reaffirming they are a domestic terrorist organization instead of a political party intent on governing responsibly

and this is their second time to prove themselves 

if someone shows you who they are and especially a second time  believe it
we are witnessing the endpoint of a twoparty system one party has a slim majority controlled by an extremist minority within itself and have essentially run on demonizing the other side

now theyre at an impasse they have no one that can get the votes within their own party and bipartisanship is now political suicide graham in 2015 was right electing trump is destroying the party and they absolutely deserve it
if those 8 idiots cant even vote for a speaker when theres two wars scalise should go right over and stay negotiating with democrats 

i doubt itll even result in sharing power because at least 5 of the 8 he needs to fold will somebody just needs to call them on their bs and start threatening consequences instead of folding to them every time

edit im realizing he only needs to scare 4 to get the gavel since one of the 8 was a moderate who personally hated mccarthy and likely will vote for him
im still waiting for mr greene ex husband to tell her to stop using his surname
i have better chance of winning the powerball than stevie winning
11399 really just shows the hold trump has over the party even beyond the 8 lunatics

now how many of the 113 would actually be willing to cross over to a moderate speaker if the far right refuses to play ball with scalise
talk about the lesser of two evils

i do think scalise seems minimally less appalling than jordan
the republican party amazes me that it continues to exist
is there a live stream yet
lets see if they can break mccarthys record
gonna have the phillies on one screen and cspan on the other
i was naive and thought this was a done deal for david dukethe_ss
cnn says a vote will not happen today
do we know how the 8 voted that is all that matters
do dems get to vote as well
they should get arnold to be speaker
absolute clown fiesta and im here for it
republicans are a complete disasterhorribly inept probably intentional to some degree burn it all down commands their leader the orange mussolini as he laughs and devours hamberders
theyre gonna have to go back to mccarthy hat in hand
here comes another shitshow
so whats the overunder for number of votes  is it higher or lower than the record set last time
15 or bust
did they pick a speaker yet
clown show 20  these whatevers are not law makers  they are fascists 
from punchbowl news

jordan will plan to vote for scalise for speaker on the floor and is encouraging colleagues to support him as well per a source with direct knowledge

i guess that is happening tomorrow

i know jordan tried that in january to little success
scalise is more uniparty than jordan
iiny miiny mighty moe

catch a rhino by his toe

if at first you dont succeed

elect a maganut like steve scalise

right repubs
this is going to be an entertaining shitshow and i am here for it
when do the votes start wanna knock off work and get my cspan on

i wonder if jeffries would ever float a caretaker speaker from outside the house
late stage empire
i know the dems wont do this they will nominate jeffries and vote in unison

but i really believe the dems should peel off a block of about 20 of their members and continually nominatevote for one of the reps that voted to approve the jan 6 commission

or for maximum laughs nominatevote for mccarthy

just enough votes to sow some chaos in the republican plans
at what point does biden just start doing whatever he needs to keep the government funded and running executive orders whatever 

what are you going to do impeach me
removed
removed
why is this politics section not saying nothing bad about biden
scalise is sadly not fit to be speaker given his cancer diagnosis

we need a speaker who is able to put their full efforts into defeating the communist democrats and save america

we must stop funding foreign wars  ukraine

we must stop the weaponized government and hold them accountable

we must secure our border

we must protect our kids

and we need a full leadership team dedicated to this fight in these unprecedented times
the timeline right before that was just as dumb august recess for an entire month only to come back and mccarthy announced a frivolous impeachment inquiry against biden in hopes of avoiding a shutdown and saving his job 

then two weeks later 48 hours before the shutdown deadline they held a complete failureflop of an impeachment hearing and ousted the only person who started it because he didnt shut down the government

truly amazing leadership
republican voters this is good for our democracy
or did i miss something

you missed how it was the democrats fault for not helping mccarthy retain his speakership thus causing all your other bullet points  why do democrats hate america so much s
by design
putins investment in helping the right wing nuts of the republican party gain power continues to pay dividends
expel the gop
they realized a while back that they dont actually have to govern to get people to vote for them they just need to yell about god and make life harder for anyone who isnt a straight white christian man
nope this is a pretty good summary

fucking clown show
yes you missed that massie said scalises plan for the government is a shutdown because he believes it gives the gop leverage so why rush if their plan is a shutdown anyway
republicans are incompetent boobs  yes you got that right
all while the israel and hamas situation unfolds 

well that only happened because biden released those funds to iran

every maga idiot
no thats pretty much it
i think the only thing you missed is they are pro shutdown and pro war but yeah good summary

edit spelling
repeal and replace house speaker version they never have a fucking plan just a bunch of mouthy bullshit to appease the fuckers that pull the lever for r every time
basically how they wanted to handle the aca

theyre really good at saying we dont know what we want but we know its not that
8 republicans ousted mccarthy its kind of disingenuous or misinformed to say they ousted him without a plan because the 8 republicans that ousted him plan is to create maximum chaos the democrats have no incentive to minimize the chaos so its a real shitshow for the rest of the gop
is that a quote
  i wonder how the dems are going to get blamed this time

the democrats refuse to work with republicans in order to get a speaker of the house grinding the government to a deadlock
jordan allegedly just offered to nominate scalise himself on the floor  let the shit show begin indeed  source jack sherman on twitterhttpsfixupxcomjakeshermanstatus1712169441302044971

correct  i do wonder however of the 93 how many were for jordon  anyone who supported jordon might be fine with scalise as their second choice  however all it takes is five republicans not to back scalise to have multipleendless rounds of voting
 i believe well have a speaker scalise in office by dinnertime tonight said rep lance gooden rtexas an early scalise backer im confident well all be on the same page when we get to the floor

lmaoooo
til more than a week is rushed
i will always upvote a firefly reference
i dont believe that man was burdened with an overabundance of schooling
8 days is a rushed process
i like billionaires in control of their own companies
if the impeachment vote was secret hed probably had been convicted
id be curious to see if the next ballot were not secret how the votes would go
republican voters like that his own party ignores him its literally part of trumps whole appeal he is an outsider

it is completely unbelievable that donald trump of all humans on earth was the person who was able to harness that anti estabishment energy but there we have it
but trump is the gop now if hes on the ballot and not elected speaker the nooses will probably be busted out again

i wonder what will happen when trump dies the gop will be up creek without a paddle
lol the gop is just so incompetent  like for real
stop the count
oh  anyone want my popcorn
after taking nearly a week off too
they want the government to shut down
what the hell was the point of the closedtothepublic secret ballot caucus vote then
unapologetic was what trump was known for of course they don want an embarrassed klansman
meh the maga conservative wing seems to be more wanting sex abusers or sex abuse enablers than duke types
this shit should get you expelled from congress holding a constitutional office hostage for political reasons pathetic
freedom caucus  i vote how donald trump tells me to
yikes 
every decision we make as a conference should be in the best interest of getting donald trump the leader of our party who will be our nominee back in the white house in 2024 thats it that is my focus

good god what a bunch of fucking fascists
oh good my dipshit gerrymandered congressfool saying dipshit things again
dont overthink it hes racist

heres a break down from 8 years ago about his david duke without the baggage comment mark potok brings the receipts and its ironic just 8 years ago the gop was actually worried about having him as a leader would make them look bad

httpsyoutubeqicpjg5rnr0si7flhifbfu_cidndm
well better make sure that man is closely monitored
republican and racist are synonyms so that was going to happen regardless
if they succeed in doing this they should stop claiming to represent the party of lincoln
 people arent dumb enough to try prevent the government from running also what the fuck is toilet paper

 the founders
i dont think there was really a choice in the matter  you want to have the new congress sworn in and leadership decided before they start making decisions  the alternative is some system where you can have a bunch of unelected people rule by fiat andor a congress refusing to leave  this is really more the republicans failure rather than a mistake by the framers

i think hes too busy with his seal team 6 duties rescuing american hostages in gaza at the moment to assume the speakership
some say the real felons are the republicans we elected along the way
hes going for the three peat eh amazing life this manmen has led
again  i mean its on his resume
i mean he was an astronaut and the first man on the moon
but he said hes already the speaker now i dont know who to believe
i hadnt heard him say hed be willing to do it again
we are all george santos on this blessed day
its by design
duke lite
the level of dysfunction is the point

they want to make the government fail and take advantage of the gaps in rules and regulations blame the opposition and most importantly disrupt foreign aids that was actively hurting antidemocratic foreign opposition

and despite what people may want to say keeping mccarthy around would not have worked he openly lied about what he would support and went back on it he proved himself to be incapable of handling the job and 100 untrustworthy to everyone which is why removing him was justified he was already as bad as any other far right lunatic for doing this for whatever reason they decided to stop supporting a functioning government the moment shutdowns began to be threatened its like a twisted version of a labor strike but coopted for much more nefarious purposes

this is the new normal for republicans as long as their constituents keep electing maga types within the gop
theres no way those 8 who voted to oust him nor any democrat will vote for mccarthy
but every democrat voted to remove mccarthy
modern repubs should really grow a pair if they want to keep their jobs join with dems and do power sharing
they took a whole week off to try to hide the disfunction and figure something out behind closed doors and this was the result fucking epic
republicans believe a lot of bs
good luck with whipping it only takes 5 intransigent members and there are likely to be waaayyy more than that especially being emboldened by nearly 100 of them not wanting to back scalise 

he could make overtures to dems if he actually wanted the gavel but its doubtful that will happenat least not until hes embarrassed himself for a bunch of voting rounds
oh im confident our allies will be fine committing war crimes without the input of the us congress
they dont care about anyone but daddy putin  he signs their rubles
how much has the stock market lost since 91
i am so torn on the one hand i want the republicans to fail spectacularly at getting scalise elected i am talking 15 rounds again on the other hand we need a budget and we need to pass aid to ukraine  

scalise better not cave to the extreme maga win like mccarthy did
give it up for ballot 23
i let out such a sensible chuckle
maybe the recess is to give them time to install the octagon
thats a hilariously selfish demand from santos  just pretend i didnt commit fraud and probably other crimes and you got my vote
beetlejuice boebert tweeted no as well
chip roy tweeted he is a no
 the rush to the bottom is almost complete

if you believe the rs are near the bottom of the barrel just wait until you see the sewage theyll be dredging up in the next decade

i truly hope this comment ages poorly
spoiler alert there is no bottom the gop is like a bag of holding its a truly bottomless barrel
 boebert is harder but can probably be whipped to vote present

shes a prohttpsichzbgrcomfull5997491712ha6981cacshopyouknowwhatin  shouldnt be a hard sell
that seems possible but until people were on record we dont really know how many nos there are the secret ballot was 113 to 99 by my math thats only 212 votes total

so some of those 99 from jordan might not come over to scalise but also some of those notvoting members might be hard for scalise to win i think until we see a floor vote we dont know how many nos there actually are some members of the gop will be quicker to publicly state their views than others

i wouldnt be surprised if youre right and scalise wins the speakership tomorrow but i wouldnt be surprised if 217 remains elusive for a while and this stretches into next week
more likely shes compromised and bought off

shes a nutbag but her moves always have a calculated dysfunction to them too and her less successful takes dont get hit hard enough to make her face actual consequences so she throws out everything else she can into the midst to disrupt the system

our country is being held hostage by the enemies of the very constitution it claims to uphold all while they say they worship it
yes but its steve scalise so 
so white supremacy is cool  but having cancer is the sticking point 

todays gop everyone
while the democrats would love to have a less shitty human being in the speakers chair the republicans arent going to give them any option who isnt at least 34 dog shit they just dont have anybody like that the democrats might prefer 34 dog shit to 44 but unanimously voting for a 34 dogshit person instead of jeffries seems a stretch especially since they can just do nothing and let the gop make headlines as the slapfighting little drama queens that they are 

once theres a speaker the speaker will force the democrats to do nothing anyway might as well do it at the gops expense
well dont forget about the terrorism angle

fall out of line and you get a barrage of death threats and you have to hire security for your family

i mean there has been reportinghttpsthehillcomhomenewshouse534113houserepublicanssaythreatsofviolencecouldbeafactorinimpeachment that republicans have changed their votes on important issues because they are scared of the maga terrorists
because they know theyll get primaried in their next election and lose their cushy 200k after fringe benefits job not counting grift
it would have to be someone who does not intend to run for reelection
or just fucking work with the democrats  the crazies that vote for you will forget all of this in three weeks anyway and just vote for the guy or girl with the r the next election anyway

they have bent over and let these insane people have power because theyve so largely given up compromise as an idea
some might have taken the bait on that like don bacon brian fitzpatrick and a couple ny congressmen but i doubt enough for 218 votes
the secret vote was 11399 so there is big division there already
really cool and awesome how the im like david duke without the baggage guy is the lesser of the two evils love how our current political system is working right now
both are garbage
we are just not today probably
i dont think they can get rid of that without a speaker theyd need to vote on it i believe
its less will he get the votes more how many votes till he gets in overunder is 125
not yet anyways
later in that interview jim jordan jim jordan from ohio name one democrat that stands behind jim jordan 
i couldnt stop laughing at that
that must have been some interesting phone call he had with putin
this isnt news  trump hates jews christians just need israel to keep existing and for jews to convert so jesus will return and rapture them
jordan has so much more baggage than that although that certainly is hideoushe thinks it is ok for congress to interfere in a state prosecution if you havent yet read the letter fani willis sent him a few weeks agoplease find it and read itespecially exhibits f through o
trump will bring the paper towels to help
imagine doing this at a real job
they wont  they just wont  let alone that theyll be primaried out of their seats theyre scared that maga will literally shoot them for being traitors to the cause

its a career ender  trump and the right wing media would tear them a new one over the next year

much simpler to stand quietly in a crowd of dysfunction than step forward and be attacked
 why the hell not

because its fucking disastrously stupid thats why the hell not the only reason all of this house fuckery isnt hurting democrats and their prospects for the next elections is because they arent close enough to any power for it to be their fault
cnn reporting they arent going to vote today so my suggestion would be to drink some electrolytes and do some light stretching
they better finish this before no nut november starts
30 more days
sadly theyll use it as evidence that biden did nothing during his term and their base will eat it up as proof that the democrats didnt accomplish anything when the truth is they were once again being obstructed by the gop controlled house
it says r next to his name on wikipedia so yes
wouldnt be surprised hes awful everything and a total trump suckup
if the random republicans were willing to do the right thing they wouldnt be republicans  so no

qed
no there is a zero percent chance of that
nah they would be putting themselves and their families in actual danger going against the cult like that
electoral dysfunction

there are pills that can help should you find yourself in this unfortunate situation
jordan is apparently throwing his support behind scalise but hard to say how many people that will sway
i bet those 8 voted for trump and we know who they are
welp long shutdown here we come
highly unlikely mccarthy has been politically castrated
because the interim speaker adjourned the house until yesterday
its true  gotta have the votes thats why hamilton had to be in the room where it happens
httpsyoutubexb6f6kiqlxwsiu_0u5udd_nidnfsr
hahaha ha hah
a devout trump support who supports him over the country
more likely that there are too many gym rats
i thought vp was second in line
there is 0 chance of the dems working with scalise the guy voted to overturn the election he is every bit as bad as jordan just not as loud mouthed as jordan
scalise negotiating with dems would end his career  trump and right wing media would pillory them and maga would make death threats if not act upon them  only thing worse in maga world than a dem is by far a perceived traitor to their cause  especially an elected one

there is zero chance of power sharing  absolute zero  none  no gop rep wants that target on their back  easier to stand in a crowd of dysfunction than to stand alone and be attacked and destroyed over it

youre hoping for gop to do the reasonable thing for the country and thats utterly misplaced  they will do what protects themselves foremost  country could shutdown for two months and theyll spin it as bidens fault  none of them truly think theyre going to bear the burden of that
on it
sexual abuse enabler vs grand wizard
i dont know which is actually worse in terms of what theyre trying to accomplish or able to accomplish but gym jordan is the most infuriating human being on the planet and if i have to listen to him any more often that i already unfortunately do itll do real harm to my blood pressure
they have a massive amount of support too  some say 35 but i think its closer to 65
it got cancelled for today because they dont have the votes they need
they dont want to embarrass themselves because they know steve doesnt have the votes yet
back to the pile boys
it was a secret ballot
the entire house gets to vote the dems are unified behind hakeem jeffries in principle jeffries only needs a handful of republicans to cross the aisle to win but that seems unlikely

so unless some republicans decide to do the unthinkable and vote jeffries the democratic votes arent that relevant its all about whether the republicans are able to unify behind a single candidate or not
yes all for jeffries is the plan
the secret vote i believe is just the republicans deciding who they want to push as their choice the actual vote to decide officially who is speaker will involve democrats
yes but its unlikely that the gop would move for a full floor vote in any scenario where jeffries could wrangle a handful of republican votes and win
i would find it incredibly funny to see democrats nominate and vote for mccarthy  really gum up their gears
id wager lower kinda looks like theyre going to not even bring it to vote until theyre positive theyve got the nutjobs in line
the republicans nominated a speaker in their own conference  they then delayed the house vote because scalise doesnt think he has the votes to win in a full house vote  then a bit before 7pm they adjourned the house until noon tomorrow  

so yes and no and its shaping up to be a less public speaker fight than mccarthys speaker votes  though well see if they bring it out to the floor tomorrow
yes scalise still tbd if he will win i guess httpswwwcnncom20231011politicshouserepublicansspeakerelectionindexhtml
this could use workshopping tbh
house convenes at 3pm i dont know if they will have any sort of regular business like 3minute speeches and the like if not i would think the votes would start around 315ish or so
hes openly compared himself to a white supremacist and voted not to certify votes for biden he is very very far right
well weve just seen that the gop wont even entertain voting on one of their own if they cant whip a majority of their own caucus so i dont see why dems wouldnt just hold firm on jeffries
nope dems dont need to do anything but vote for the best option for house speaker and thats jeffries
disagree  if republicans want democrats to fix their problems for them the bare minimum they should do is peel off 6 members to vote for jefferies
8th grade civics just dropped to its knees in a walmart
thats an absurd hill to die on 

ukraine dies unless the fbi lets me read their investigation notes

what an absolute clown
the genocidal maniac you seem to want is not going to have enough votes
sounds like we won yet again 

why you guys keep getting your ass beat in politics
what does biden have to do with the house speaker
because the guy is kicking ass and taking names not really much bad to say about the guy
are you sad that house gop is such a shitshow its all anyone is talking about

for the first time in us history republicans shitcanned their own speaker 

and for the first time ever they cant find a replacement for an entire week
what bad thing could you possibly expect us to say about hunter bidens penis
you came to a thread about the gop continuing to fail at running the house to ask why no one is saying bad things about biden

geeze usually these whataboutisms are more subtle
that hamster is suffering a heart attack after it ran so hard
why create an account just to give this opinion be brave post from your real account and stand by what you are saying
brother who do you think is weaponizing the government
communist democrats

i wonder why you guys are losing elections
are you kevin mccarthy
removed
 scalise is sadly not fit to be speaker given his cancer diagnosis

and the whole being a klansman thing david duke without the baggage i believe was how he described himself

 we need a speaker who is able to put their full efforts into defeating the communist democrats and save america

please define communism in this context because its probably not what yknow the accepted definition is

 we must stop funding foreign wars  ukraine

and where do you stand on israel

 we must stop the weaponized government and hold them accountable

the only ones weaponizing it are the republicans trying to find any evidence whatsoever against biden and failing while turning a blind eye to the blatant proof against not only their presumptive presidential nominee but a good chunk of their legislators

prosecuting people for provable crimes is not weaponized government its just government

 we must secure our border

seems pretty secure in fact more immigrants and drugs have been stopped coming across than trump ever managed to do

 we must protect our kids

from whom gaetz who traffics them or jordan who lets them get abused and covers it up or boebert who gives handjobs in front of them

 and we need a full leadership team dedicated to this fight in these unprecedented times

unprecedented how exactly the only unprecedented thing i see is the republicans collapsing under the weight of their bigotry into a bunch of infighting backstabbers
well whos it going to be then

seems to me anybody eligible doesnt have widespread support and anybody else isnt in the running for it
 we must stop funding foreign wars

but send money to israel immediately

fucking useless hypocrites

the rest of your points are fox buzzwords that dont make any sense to anyone outside magooland
i was trying to keep it contained to october im working so i cant go back to last month and then the month before that itd take too long
and the impeachment inquiry has no subpoena power because its not official it wasnt voted on per the rules the gop put in place

so its literally just a mock inquiry theater
man i wish i could show up to work that little and still get paid
that impeachment inquiry is so transparent nobody even cares anymore
so i think a lot of rs dont want to be the majority party but retain enough of a minority to stop legislation that hurts their donors they vote no dont do any actual work and praise jesus to appease the christians

certain companies love this situation and support rs for this they can keep going status quo yadda yadda yadda

but when they have a majority some use it to help thier donors tax cuts enrich themselves and do whatever earns them money andor votes

but then trump showed that an idiot could do it so the idiots ran and the idiots started fancy themselves acfual leaders and not the kid in the group who contribures nothing and throws a fit when he has to work
so is the biden impeachment thing essentially over now
you see government doesnt work
i actually kind of love this argument its a complete and total capitulation to the fact that republicans are utterly incapable of even the most basic competence required to govern youd have to have a total void where your selfawareness should be to unironically say democrats should just hold their nose and strategically vote for the least harmful gop speaker its the right thing to do when that would take all democrats acting in unison and only five republicans to do the opposite hold their nose and strategically vote for jeffries

but everyone even the most hardline gop voters know that there is no world where you get that kind of coordination from the gop there arent five gop reps that would put america over themselves like that so they have no choice but to try to beg intimidate or shame the dems into doing it for them strategically voting against their own wishes where the gop wouldnt dare even though it takes monumentally more effort because we all know only the dems are good for it

democrats need to step in translates exactly to democrats need to babysit the idiot party before they get themselvesus killed theres no other interpretation
and before that mccarthy badmouthing dems in the media blaming shutdown on them and generally talking trash
how could joe biden do this to us s
thanks obama
my father liked to say politics was a pendulum  i said yeah until trump smashed it through the side of the clock

this is now republicans complaining that the clock is broken
its such a hilarious argument 

the opposing party should have put country over party and voted against the 8 extremists that triggered this 

those extremists are members of your party you only have the majority because of them if you cant control them and they are truly extremists and not republicans than democrats have the majority and it should be a democrat as speaker of the house

why do you hate this country
fucking clown show

this is the tagline for all republicans running for office these days  it should be on all their yard signs as it would really go a long way to attracting the right wing nuts they need to win elections
i was going to be a clown this halloween but nope
gop beat me to it too bad it has real frightening consequences
yeshttpswwwtheguardiancomusnews2023oct03stevescalisehousespeakerrepublicans
yes spoken by none other than steveo himself

when a someone blames the democrats for this i ask them what they think republicans should do if the tables were turned and not one has ever said they should vote to save democrats but this is different for reasons
i can already see the cnn headlines now
it would only take a handful of republicans crossing the aisle and making a deal for there to be a new speaker but in modern american politics bipartisanship only goes one way
i dont think jordan really wants to be speaker
doesnt that mean its more likely ss gets elected speaker if jordan and now gaetz are supporting
eh tfw gym realizing his past under a spotlight isnt good for his health 
they could probably pull it off i think scalise has a better chance than mccarthy no gaetz seems to be on board this time
thats because its only a winwin for jordan

he supports scalise and either scalise wins a majority and jordan keeps his chairmanship on the judicial committee or scalise doesnt get to the majority and has first act as leader is a failed nomination and they are hung again just enough for jordan to say seee i tried to bring the party together but some of them just will not budge unless they are voting for me
whats approval voting
give them another month maybe 1 week before the 45 days is up they will wake up
hes not wrong about that but thats because hes counting every day between november elections and january speaker votes as the normal timeline

which wasnt even enough to stop 15 rounds for mccarthy so yeah he does have a point that they are super dysfunctional in their inability to coalesce around a choice

maybe if the rnc had a platform and wasnt simply recycling the same platform literally since the 2016 election it even mentions the current administration in the negative which was obama in 2016 but was a self own in 2020 when it was trump and they reused it word for word  they couldnt modify it without voting on changes  a new platform and they either feared they couldnt get consensus andor didnt want to publicize the party fighting that would have been

so instead they stand for nothing since they refuse to acknowledge what they stand for  recycling the 2016 platform was a procedural move to avoid admitting they dont know

and what happens when the party is so divisive that they cant figure out what they stand for  morons get in on vagueness and we find an inability to function
these are the people that screamed repeal and replace for almost a decade and a half until they got their chanceand had literally no plan other than repeal and bring back all the old shit like preexisting conditions
i will always upvote a firefly reference

i will always upvote an i will always upvote a firefly reference reference
cant stop the signal steve  kevin probably
i guess when you go on vacation for 7 of them it is 

useless people
yeah they gotta go 60 so they can try to blame a thanksgiving shutdown on biden and the democrats
i mean we wouldnt want to leave lots of time to work on the spending bills this whole fiasco is allegedly about right
pretty sure that when democrats vote for a speaker theyre finished in one day
i like my presidents unindicted
as soon as you said i like billionaires trump was immediately excluded
now imagine all the liberal ideas that would be law today if all votes were secret
well see  the only vote that matters the one before the full house is not secret
 i wonder what will happen when trump dies the gop will be up creek without a paddle

ive been trying to think of another racist game show host that has been on tv forever and has built up a solid reputation for opposing the black president in the media but i havent been able to think of one

so im thinking the torch will get passed to whichever altright republican gets up on stage and drops the nword in their presidential campaign announcement speech
theyve spent 25 years with no actual approach other than tax cuts for rich people and opposition to everything else  of course they are a shit show
can you stop a count when you havent started counting

what an absolute shitshow lol
motions to vacate are tiring
to vote for speaker under the hopes that the extremists would adhere to the vote  under normal circumstances it wouldnt matter but with republicans thin majority and how annoying their extremists are the chances of some of them just accepting what the majority wants isnt likely unless they get something out of it a functioning house isnt enough

 holding a constitutional office hostage for political reasons

thats the gop in a nutshell

when war broke out in israel it took foxnews all of 2 seconds to start blaming biden for it
can you feel the freedom i feel it
freedom caucus  please tread on me donaldvladimir
if they surrender honest abe what little credibility their party had disappears they also cant feign that democrats are the party of slavery bullshit anymore
i mean they should regardless republicans only trot out that line whenever theyre rightfully accused of racism otherwise its confederate flags and southern heritage all the way doesnt sound very lincolnlike to me

theres also the inconvenient fact that southern conservatives fucking despised lincoln the party of lincoln was used as an epithet during the reconstruction days and they didnt start migrating to the republican party until after lbj a southern democrat signed the civil rights act a move seen as a betrayal by the dixiecrats who considered lbj one of their own
boebert will forget to vote because she too busy giving an over the pants handy in the back row
santos will require an id check at the door so he can commit more alleged identity theft
dont bring george santos into this that man is a hero  he was the first navy seal to land on mars and came back alive to tell about it  also the man is in mourning as his mother recently died for the third time  please have some respect
delta farce and meal team 6 had the capitol surrounded
when you are at your lowest with no one at your side and you dont know who to trust you can always trust in george santos

remember when the two of you were walking on the beach and there were two sets of tracks and suddenly they dwindled into one that was george santos blasting off in a jetpack to fight nazis on the moon
i would love for republicans to mess up vote present and accidentally make jeffries speaker  it would sum up the party perfectly  i dont know if it works that way
its really by definition at this point  they boiled off all of the people with reasoning skills  its distilled gullibility now
yeah hes going to have to bribe members and hes going to end up over the same barrel they bent mccarthy over
not gonna deny that israel is fucked up but not decapitating literal babies fucked up
i doubt the house will pass aid to ukraine id also expect a government shutdown in november
scalise has publicly compared himself to the leader of the kkk he is maga extremism
you know whats funnier than ballot 24
in politics there are no morals there is just leverage

lucky for santos he might just have enough leverage
do you expect anything else from a republican
this bodes really poorly for him
 the gop is like a bag of holding

sick reference bro your references are outta control
a lot of the texas reps were in houston for the osirisrex presser then they were going to the cape to watch psyche lets see if they decide national security is more important
honestly i hate her more than gaetz and thats saying a lot
new york is going to be redistricting and new york republicans will be regerrymandered out of their seats next election i dont know if they realize it but theyre toast either way if they do realize it there would be no use helping dems if theyre just being gerrymandered out of their seats next election
it only has to be about 8 who dont plan on running for reelection
would be amazing if the first thing that happened was a vote to vacate  lol
the play would be targeting gop reps in bluetopurple districts so the play would be to heat them up with their fear of being primaried against their fear of losing the general
yeah republicans would much rather negotiate with terrorists
tomorrow my body will be ready
washington post says theyre going live for the vote in 8 minutes im confused
not as much as jim
stupid how they are letting themselves literally be held hostage by their voters
i think it is those 8 others that are the problem just like in january
no one really knows how the parties get to yes the pieces that are sacrificed in every game of chess click boom then it happened
lol the most recent comments are people saying the mccarthy vote had them singing this hahaha
think they mean like vp is 1st in line then speaker is 2nd in line if vp dies or whatever
i dont expect him to do it i think he should threaten it

and yes i do think democrats would work with him if the opportunity actually came up not only are they the adults in the room but the political victory would be so enormous theyd be stupid to not take it
david duke without the baggage
among who because its not 65 of all americans
deleted
when will the next performance will be
these gop legislators have been fucking and sucking their way across america in the hope of raising awareness for the speakership
yes but those loudmouths are called loudmouths for a reason
i mean theres a few republicans that are so fed up with the maga republicans maybe theres a a chance they will see the light
deleted
haaa would have to give some big concession to the dems
would he be entitled to two portraits or just the one
fuck that let mccarthy get voted in again after another 15 rounds
and who knows what theyll have to give up to even get those votes
these nut jobs could absolutely promise them yes votes and then vote no just fuck with them and the limpdicked gop cant do shit about it because they need their votes to pass anything
lol

burn
the h in rino is causing me pain for sure
the fourth line has way too many syllables its like no effort was put in pedestrian
thanks kindly
yay then they can share some of the blame if the government shuts down sounds like a real corker of an idea
and wept over a bucket of ice cream

not a tub a literal gentlemen this is a bucket bucket
do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down
im talking about in general this entire politics
lol and the evidence that has come out of that inquiry has been mind blowing and indefensible
its what theyve done for 30 years they know the democrats will actually govern so they can pull whatever performative bullshit they want to steal from the american people and crash the economy they know the democrats will fix it when theyre in power thus derailing their agenda and the republicans will blame them for the shitty economy in the first place
crazy thing is democrats would if he you know gave into some demands a compromise if you will

he said no
yet every r voter will never understand this or repeat it at least not outwardly theyll just say well at least they arent democrats or else it would be even worse thats literally their only way out which convieniently lets them justify continuing this insanity so of course its the one they take every single fucking time
and only five republicans to do the opposite hold their nose and strategically vote for jeffries

they wouldnt even have to vote for jeffries necessarily its not like theyve tried a different compromise candidate a different democrat or a more moderate republican and been rejected

no its immediately democrats need to vote for mccarthy
and refusing any overtures democrats made to negotiate a deal 

like democrats didnt even actually refuse to help save his speakership but if they were going to help and become part of his coalition to be elected of course they were going to want concessions he wasnt willing to give
i wouldnt read much into what he is saying to the media gop 101 is to blame democrats for everything to the media and dont give any soundbites to dems hardliners view any compromise as weakness and not as a strength and that is really the essence of the problem the speaker has to compromise to get anything done especially with such a thin margin i also think we should give mccarthy some credit he saved us from a shutdown the freedom caucus wanted to oust the speaker after the shutdown so the whole body would be paralyzed and maga could have essentially threatened to blow everything up unless they get their way
i am desperate to know what he meant by this to a sane person david dukes defining feature is the white supremacy and that is baggage i dont know what is left if you take that away is david duke known for something else in circles where white supremacy is a given or is the public knowledge of said white supremacy the baggage
wow

no it is not see my response earlier in this thread unless you have a source indicating otherwise

it only take a few democrates to vote with the gop

it also only take a few republicans to vote for jeffries

why would the republicans vote for a democrat
i think the way attention ramped up in the last few days to his past abuse coverups spooked him
easier to get away with things in the shadows
all i know is those initials should make him a shoe in with todays republicans
why do you think the people that have screamed for years that governent was broken would suddenly want to fix it when they are about to shutdown with no speaker this is literally what these traitors have been practicing for they will intentionally crater the country becausereasonslike democrats existing or something
that was serenity not firefly proper you uncultured heathen
i like presidents who dont sell state secrets
true  also i dont actually like billionaires so i guess there was a lot of misinformation there
or worse how many horrible bills would be passed if there were no accountability for those voting
but i havent been able to think of one

unfortunately i have tucker carlson at least if you consider fox to be a game show
their approach was to get their people into the judiciary while destroying the congress  so now their policies can be created from the bench with almost no way to stop them or push back  

but as part of that they ended up with absolute morons throughout their whole party
i guess so but shows how laughably short the house gops memory is cuz we saw that all play out back when mccarthy had to go through 12 votes to win speaker the first time and had to give in to so many of the hfcs demands
that assumes they have a spine and balls to affect
who would program the ai
narrator it does
pretty much 

alternatively he could give up some fairly minor concessions to the dems ukraine funding end the impeachment bullshit more equal committee representation and probably get the full dem caucus behind him such that the threats of a motion to vacate become meaningless
ballot 25
insert why not both meme here
deleted
theyre more afraid of their own than dems  they have to get through primary season first  after that they can try to shape their general campaign
at this point i think republicans in the house are more scared of the violence and threats that will be unleashed on them if they vote vote a democrat rather than keeping their seats you know normal conservative stuff
as long as the terrorists have an r next to their name then yes
they are going to gavel to order and then recess its just a procedural step
ah gotcha that makes sense thanks
tell me you dont know how politics work without telling me you dont know how politics work
i hope they keep the 1 asshole can remove the speaker rule

learning from mistakes is woke
so far going against the grain has meant expulsion for republicans see also cheney and kinzinger

i dont have high hopes for the socalled moderate republicans seeing the light and kicking maga to the curb by siding with jeffries in the speaker vote
they dont even need to vote for jeffries they just need to vote present
theyd require that concession to be made up front  he cant be trusted at his word hes already repeatedly proven that
ill bite

eeny meeny mighty moe  
  
catch a rhino by his toe  
  
if at first you want some lies  
  
elect a maganut like steve scalise
bullshit the dems are voting for the best candidate period the gop are the ones disjointed and seeking to shut things down the very few members that that isnt true for can always vote for jeffries for the sake of bipartisanship
the difference is the dems are willing to go moderate on certain things so theyll be able to appeal to some of the republicans considering the dems worked with mccarthy to prevent the most recent shutdown
uh no the democrats are not responsible for cleaning up the mess of the republicans reps have the majority they cannot figure their own house out but you expect the dems to bail them out absolutely not
right its up to the house majority to get their shit together not the minority
i dont know why this is making me laugh so hard
its not 217
just go ahead and type out the bad things you wanna type out
its by design part of the republican tenets is that government is ineffective and a waste of money they prove it by making the government ineffective and wasteful of money i mean when in the last that the deficit under a republican presidency didnt fucking explode the seventies

to add every democrat administration since that trend started  has either lowered the deficit or ended with surplus thats not a political argument thats history thats a fucking fact
the baggage is that david duke is a known racist

scalise is saying that he has all the racist ideas and rhetoric without having actually publicly being involved with the klan
i am desperate to know what he meant by this

dont overthink it hes racist

heres a break down from 8 years ago about his baggage comment  mark potok brings the receipts

httpsyoutubeqicpjg5rnr0si7flhifbfu_cidndm
would it help if you knew he also attended and spoke at david dukes europeanamerican unity and rights organization

dude is a straight up white supremacist
maybe hes referring to the pointy bags that he wore when he was the grand wizard of the kkk
httpsamptheguardiancomusnews2023oct03stevescalisehousespeakerrepublicans
heres hoping the pressure stays ramped up and he doesnt get to be speaker
i like presidents who arent orange
this

the only way to keep democracy sane is to shine a light on it  when it is held in the dark it quickly stops being democracy

yes we are in a bad position now  largely as a result of the actions of the gop over the past 50 years  this is because of problems that were not sufficiently predicted andor publicized when certain rules and legislations were implemented

we need more transparency and more public oversight not less
pat sajak just retired and i hear hes pretty diehard maga
that would require being an adult

is he an adult
thatd be flip flopping for sure

can you not read

giving jeffries the speakership would be volunteering to clean up their mess and because they have the majority it would fail and the the democrats through jeffries would start getting a bunch of the fucking blame dumped on them you think the media wont waste a single chance to bring it up every time something goes wrong or the government shuts down breaking house speaker jeffries fails to prevent shutdown etc etc

my whole point is that they shouldnt be bailed out politically giving a democrat the speakership is bailing them out because it allows them to spread the blame around for the dysfunction in the eyes of the lowinformation voter
too many to list in one post

hes a republican so no
id rather be naive and even the tiniest amount hopeful for a sensible outcome over siding with the racists seditionists and traitors
start with five then
and what is the source of your quoted article or report
nah unless theres some contradictory claim that he didnt say it theres no reason not to take the report at face value

 but given how human memory works it probably didnt

what someone remembering something means it probably didnt happen thats exactly what you just said  what are you even trying to imply here exactly what is your agenda

they remember it happening no one remembers it differently youre calling a stranger a liar for literally no reason it happened the source that it didnt happen is you your personal cynicism with no stated rationale to back it up why would someone believe you over a reporter what is your authority on the subject
i just flashed back to every argument i ever had with an adult when i was in middle school"
